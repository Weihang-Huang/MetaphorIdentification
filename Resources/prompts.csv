Explanation: 
burst your bubble
The phrase “burst your bubble” has a more basic contemporary meaning: in other contexts, a “bubble” is a thin sphere of liquid enclosing air, and “bursting” it would break it. In this example, it describes shattering someone’s hopes or illusions by comparing them to literally popping a bubble, which makes it a metaphorical usage.
full-fledged

it's labute's <Metaphor> half hearted </Metaphor> attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesn't even seem to have <Metaphor> half that heart </Metaphor> in it .
