      "\n",
      "to date , the most smoothly done were straightforward \" haircuts \" of the classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization , usually one in possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining claim . \n",
      "\n",
      "most of these grew out of venerable , but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane . \n",

      " ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget . ) \n",
      "\n",

      "the lady is helen , played by the stunning jean tripplehorn , who isn't given a chance to be stunning , or even interesting , by the mediocre and unimaginative script . \n",
      "\n",
      "the child enola , played by tina majorino , is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie ; she outshines her material all the way through . \n",
      "\n",
      "in simple , the scene is earth , hundreds of years from now . \n",
      "\n",
      "the polar ice caps have melted , and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet . \n",
