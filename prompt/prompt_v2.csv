The phrase “half hearted” has a more basic contemporary meaning: in other contexts, it implies having only half of one’s literal heart. At the same time, in these cases, the heart is used to metaphorically represent effort. To do something ‘wholeheartedly’ means to do something with full effort. Here, therefore, to make a ‘half hearted attempt’ describes a lack of genuine effort, which makes it a metaphorical usage. 
half that heart
The phrase “half that heart” continues the metaphor of a literal heart, suggesting even less genuine commitment. It describes how the director invests minimal passion, making it a metaphorical usage."
