half that heart
The phrase “half that heart” continues the metaphor of a literal heart, suggesting even less genuine commitment. It describes how the director invests minimal passion, making it a metaphorical usage."

it's labute's <Metaphor> half hearted </Metaphor> attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesn't even seem to have <Metaphor> half that heart </Metaphor> in it . 
Explanation: 
half hearted 
The phrase “half hearted” has a more basic contemporary meaning: in other contexts, it implies having only half of one’s literal heart. At the same time, in these cases, the heart is used to metaphorically represent effort. To do something ‘wholeheartedly’ means to do something with full effort. Here, therefore, to make a ‘half hearted attempt’ describes a lack of genuine effort, which makes it a metaphorical usage. 
half that heart
The phrase “half that heart” continues the metaphor of a literal heart, suggesting even less genuine commitment. It describes how the director invests minimal passion, making it a metaphorical usage."

tweaking
The word “tweaking” typically refers to physically twisting or pinching something slightly. In this example, it describes making small adjustments to the formula, which makes it a metaphorical usage. 
invigorate
“Invigorate” generally refers to giving physical energy or vitality. Here, it describes enlivening the film’s proceedings by comparing it to physically energizing something, which makes it a metaphorical usage. 
ramble aimlessly towards
“Ramble” usually refers to walking or roaming without direction. In this example, it describes the film’s storyline meandering toward its ending, which makes it a metaphorical usage. 
offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way
“Offering” commonly refers to physically presenting or giving something. In this example, it describes providing only limited enjoyable moments, which are not tangible objects that can be literally ‘offered’, which makes it a metaphorical usage. Further, ‘offering’ is generally something that can only be done by an animate actor. In this case, the film is being described as doing the ‘offering’, making it an example of a personification metaphor.
