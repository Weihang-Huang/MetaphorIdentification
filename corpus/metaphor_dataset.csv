about ten years back , with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior , post-apocalypse nitty-gritty survival <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">yarns</node> became popular at the movies . 

we've always had movies of this nature ; on the beach , the end of the world , damnation alley , the ultimate warrior , and so on . 

to date , the most <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">smoothly</node> done were straightforward "" <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">haircuts</node> "" of the classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization , usually one in possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining claim . 

most of these <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">grew out</node> of venerable , but <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">solid</node> hero <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">yarns</node> like the virginian and shane . 

 ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget . ) 

now we have waterworld , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter . 

 ( well , she's not a widow , and the kid isn't her daughter , but you get the idea . ) 

the lady is helen , played by the stunning jean tripplehorn , who isn't given a chance to be stunning , or even interesting , by the mediocre and unimaginative script . 

the child enola , played by tina majorino , is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie ; she <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">outshines</node> her <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">material</node> all the way through . 

in simple , the scene is earth , hundreds of years from now . 

the polar ice caps have melted , and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet . 

the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies , and survive by trade , theft , or piracy . 

somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries , and its inhabitants , called "" smokers , "" are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials , so the bad guys have outboard engines , and fast-moving boats , airplanes , and jet skis . 

enola , found at sea as a young girl , has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back .

played with typical self-lampooning , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">rug-chewing</node> histrionics by dennis hopper , "" deacon "" is the only thing in the movie that's close to amusing . 

his performance is * almost * laughable , but there just isn't enough there to be funny . 

the star ( and a co-producer ) is kevin costner . 

he's playing an un-named lone denizen of the sea , a man called the "" mariner , "" who turns out to be a gilled , water-breathing mutant with webbed feet . 

very little is done with this . 

the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">support</node> a human metabolism ; it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted , much of the earth's surface would still be above water ; and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown . 

 ( canned meat does * not * last for centuries ; ammunition does * not * fire after it's more than a few decades old ; and so on , and so on . . . ) 

i'm quite fond of tina majorino's previous work , very impressed by jean tripplehorn's past accomplishments , and still speechless over costner's dances with wolves . 

but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it ! 

this movie cost one hundred and eighty-two million dollars , and there's * nothing * in it we haven't seen before , done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey . 

at 125 minutes of <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">material</node> , this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make . 

the budget of this movie * could * have given us over thirty movies ; it could have paid for six years of a prime-time sf tv series with expensive fx work , or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx . 

in sum , this movie is beneath contempt . 

it has nothing new to offer , it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc , and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation . 

if you * have * to go see it , see it on a four-dollar matinee . 

otherwise you'll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface , for weeks .

the skinheads beat steve , then force him to watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again . 

when sam kills herself later that evening , steve decides that the skinheads must be <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">taught a lesson</node> . 

waiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to forget about the incident entirely , steve shaves his head , dresses in combat boots and suspenders , tattoos his flesh with nazi symbols , and tries to infiltrate the gang . 

as he gets closer and closer to the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend , he begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to question his own motives for violence . 

randolph kret's script , based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the film's producer shaun hill , is an <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">affront</node> on violence and intolerance . 

the film causes its audience to be subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one can't help but be disgusted by the events presented within . 

i've seen it said that this is the film fight club should have been , but david fincher's film was trying to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">define</node> a generation .

064BDFD7-4C6A-4592-9BD6-98D1376950C0,"plot : a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bunch</node> of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention . 

the boys eventually get together to split the money , but as plans change , double-crosses occur , dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road . 

who's on the up and up , who's the real bad guy and who's gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie . 

critique : the funnest movie that i've seen so far this year ! 

it's got style , it's got tough guys talkin' <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">shite</node> and it's got <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">plenty of bullets to go around</node> . 

a definite hunk-a-hunk-a burnin' adventure ! 

a guy's guy movie through and through , and one that'll <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">set your jollies to high</node> if you <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">dig on</node> the rough stuff . 

it's not very original , it goes on for a little too long , but costner and russell make it happen , as two <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">shite-kickin'</node> elvis lovers , who don't stop till they , more or less , drop . 

this movie's got some pretty intensive shoot-out scenes , one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i've ever witnessed , featuring several elvises with guns a blazin' and the king's music playing in the background , and a decent <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">helping</node> of double-crosses , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sharp</node> dialogue and funny moments . 

in fact , even though the cast is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">filled</node> with many name actors ( b-actors as they might be for the most part ) , most of them do their bit and succeed well in <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">passing the torch</node> onto the next victim . 

but the true <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">glue that holds this film together</node> , other than the spirit of elvis himself , is costner and russell , who play their badass characters to the t . sure , russell's been down this road before , but costner surprised me with his nastiness . 

i guess he's pissed at all the box-office <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bombs</node> that he's been in of late , but he sure played a great <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">unstable</node> elvis impersonating robber here . 

in the end , the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bottom line</node> with this movie is having fun , kickin' ass and making sure there's enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards .

a definite hunk-a-hunk-a burnin' adventure ! 

a guy's guy movie through and through , and one that'll <Metaphor> set your jollies to high </Metaphor> if you <Metaphor> dig on </Metaphor> the rough stuff . 

it's not very original , it goes on for a little too long , but costner and russell make it happen , as two <Metaphor> shite-kickin' </Metaphor> elvis lovers , who don't stop till they , more or less , drop . 

this movie's got some pretty intensive shoot-out scenes , one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i've ever witnessed , featuring several elvises with guns a blazin' and the king's music playing in the background , and a decent <Metaphor> helping </Metaphor> of double-crosses , <Metaphor> sharp </Metaphor> dialogue and funny moments . 

in fact , even though the cast is <Metaphor> filled </Metaphor> with many name actors ( b-actors as they might be for the most part ) , most of them do their bit and succeed well in <Metaphor> passing the torch </Metaphor> onto the next victim . 

but the true <Metaphor> glue that holds this film together </Metaphor> , other than the spirit of elvis himself , is costner and russell , who play their badass characters to the t . sure , russell's been down this road before , but costner surprised me with his nastiness . 

i guess he's pissed at all the box-office <Metaphor> bombs </Metaphor> that he's been in of late , but he sure played a great <Metaphor> unstable </Metaphor> elvis impersonating robber here . 

in the end , the <Metaphor> bottom line </Metaphor> with this movie is having fun , kickin' ass and making sure there's enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards .

in case you don't know , dante's peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it's shadow , dante's peak ( who would've guessed , eh ? ) . 

pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and , perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof , is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future . 

due to the lack of more substantial evidence , nobody warns the small town , and when they finally do , it's in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows . 

brosnan , all around good guy , will , of course , save the day . 

 . 

 . 

or at least the mayor of dante's peak ( linda hamilton ) . 

naturally the two will become infatuated with one another . 

 ( if you think i just ruined a plot development , you haven't seen very many movies ! ) 

there's also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings . 

and of course , the kids or the dog ( at least one or the other ) will do something heroic . 

 . 

 . 

but hey , i don't want to ruin all the surprises ! 

if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante's peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time , i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself . 

it's not brain food , but it succeeds at what it's meant to be . 

 . 

 . 

an enjoyable , suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash !

","the working title for no looking back was long time , nothing new , and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture . 

even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes , it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics . 

writer/director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline , the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn't spent their life in seclusion . 

instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings , burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion , offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way . 

no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful . 

the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide , and the sooner , the better . 

alas , that's not the case , and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio . 

and , to further depress audiences , burns has shot the entire film on cold , rainy days in a gray new york state beach town . 

peeks of sunshine are few and far between . 

no wonder the characters are all so miserable . 

first of all , we have charlie ( burns ) , a generation x slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion , then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home . 

that girlfriend is claudia ( lauren holly ) , and , after picking up the pieces of her life following charlie's departure , she has moved on , shacking up with one of charlie's old school buddies , mike ( jon bon jovi ) . 

the two have a comfortable relationship , but it's apparent to even a blind person that they're not right for each other . 

claudia years for some spice in her life ; mike wants to settle down and have children . 

then charlie re-enters the mix . 

so who , if anyone , will claudia end up with ? 

who cares ? ? 

no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that we're not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle . 

so what if no one finds happiness -- these characters don't deserve it anyway , especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time . 

they aren't real people -- they're a writer's construct stumbling through a too-obvious storyline . 

they should know the ending as well as we do . 

and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two . 

another frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentially-interesting supporting characters . 

blythe danner is solid as claudia's housebound mother , connie britton is suitably high-strung as claudia's neurotic sister , and jennifer esposito is eye-catching as a bartender in search of a little romance .

none of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes . 

edward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here . 

jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career , but he could still use a little polish .

15AD9A28-74F9-4900-84D6-98D12518214C,"there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">strong</node>-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors . 

when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hard</node> time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture . 

you see , patch adams <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">revolted</node> me <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">beyond all boundaries </node>. 

i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">simpering</node> , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">plaguing</node> my memories . 

i hate every <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">element</node> of the film , beginning with tom shadyac's shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">mishandled</node> themes that the screenplay <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">wants</node> so desperately to convey . 

the badness of patch adams is stupefying . 

it's confounding . 

i can't believe a film can be this bad . 

and yet , it's based on a real man who probably has a good <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">point</node> to make . 

in the film , patch is played by the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">undefeatable</node> and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sledgehammer</node> sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human . 

in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn't want to kill himself . 

while there , he notices that the doctors don't care about the patients , and that the best way to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">get through</node> to the patients is to treat them like human beings . 

so , patch goes on a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">crusade</node> to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients . 

he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it's good to help people . 

he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">go through the motions</node> and be a successful doctor . 

naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">highest </node>scores on all of his exams . 

so patch decides that he's going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have . 

and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 . 

on a superficial <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">level</node> , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">aiming for</node> ( i actually liked potter's performance , even if she is wasted ) . 

but the film fails fundamentally in execution . 

every scene <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">swells</node> with grand , "" emotional "" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hard</node> . 

take , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus . 

we don't know patch yet , but there's sad music , and it's supposed to make us really sad that he's sad . 

later on , patch <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">makes a lot of progress</node> : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively . 

and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad . 

but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">center</node> of the emotions . 

real drama is character-based . 

you <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">grow </node>to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it . 

we don't ever <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">grow</node> to know the dying patient ; he's simply a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">vehicle</node> for patch's greatness . 

real drama doesn't seem <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">forced</node> , or present just to make the audience cry . 

that's why patch adams is not real drama . 

it goes for every <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">cheap</node> tear imaginable , <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene</node> . 

even scenes that have very little <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">impact</node> on the overall film are <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">drowning</node> in marc shaiman's <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">sickening</node> musical score . 

sentimentality like this is indeed bad . 

but it's not as bad as <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">half-baked</node> , simplistic themes . 

you see , patch is a really great student . 

he aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he's cheating . 

but patch doesn't think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor . 

 "" why don't we see patients until the third year ? "" he bursts out every three seconds . 

well , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . 

not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . 

most of us have to study . 

and a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn't know a toe from a finger , probably won't be too successful in preventing death . 

oh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to "" prevent death , "" but to "" improve the quality of life ! "" 

yes ! 

that is true ! 

and you can not do that without studying . 

you can not do that without going to medical school . 

what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . 

<node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">follow</node> the rules ? 

bah ! 

who needs the rules ! 

only uptight doctors <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">follow</node> the rules . 

the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . 

and then there's the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . 

a free clinic . 

in the middle of the forest . 

where patients can be taken to be helped . 

for free . 

how will patients be transported to the free clinic ? 

will it have an emergency room ? 

or is it just for mental patients ? 

and who , may i ask , will pay for it ? 

the film does give some token attempts to question patch's motives ( i think another character asks him how he's going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don't <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">explore</node> or <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">challenge</node> patch's ideas to any meaningful <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">extent</node> . 

reader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams . 

i know nothing about him . 

if his beliefs <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">mirror </node>those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them . 

but regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">put forth </node>in this film are simplistic and phony . 

and in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus</node> , patch does a lot of shouting . 

actually , robin williams does a lot of shouting . 

he shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">moved</node> by his words . 

i won't tell you that you can't be <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">moved</node> by his words , because i , too , was <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">moved</node> by his words .

2D2ABB6C-0176-458C-A0D6-98D1369BCF90,"after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again . 

there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice . 

 "" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , "" he says , "" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon . ' "" 

of course , it's meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sobriety</node> . 

you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience . 

experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">weaving</node> them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts . 

trust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">point</node> . 

juzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">follow</node> the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pattern</node> of an american western , set in modern day japan . 

a stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fend off</node> the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) . 

goro , to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">defend</node> the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious . 

goro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">flock to</node> from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen . 

the problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">appetizing</node> . 

however , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy . 

this film is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">filled</node> with many <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">little</node> scenes which are absolute <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">gems</node> . 

take , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner . 

the price is too <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">high</node> , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum . 

tampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room . 

she protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists . 

just when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door . 

she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">filled</node> with a joy that can be felt by the audience . 

this scene , while comical , is very effective at <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">filling</node> the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery . 

there's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bunch</node> of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers . 

we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet . 

the scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all . 

there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives . 

a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor . 

surrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life . 

her husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner . 

the viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this . 

in a near miracle , the wife <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">drags herself</node> to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family . 

as the family eats , she looks on them and smiles . 

preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy . 

then she falls over , dead . 

for a moment , the family is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">stunned</node> , but then the father yells at the children , "" keep eating ! 

this is the last meal your mother ever made ! "" 

crying as they do so , the family finishes the meal . 

the scene is comical , awkward , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">moving</node> , and beautiful . 

by including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">disjointed</node> film , but surprisingly , they do not <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">interrupt</node> the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pacing</node> of the main storyline . 

instead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo's goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble . 

because the film parodies a western , the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">construction</node> of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the "" good guys "" come together for the final showdown . 

in this case , the showdown is against the ramen . 

if they eat tampopo's ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded . 

it's pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">perspective</node> on something you consume every day of your life , you can <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">afford</node> to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">cut it a little slack</node> .

it's pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole <Metaphor> perspective </Metaphor> on something you consume every day of your life , you can <Metaphor> afford </Metaphor> to <Metaphor> cut it a little slack </Metaphor> . 

","after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again . 

there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice . 

 "" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , "" he says , "" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon . ' "" 

of course , it's meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety . 

you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience . 

experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts . 

trust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point . 

juzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan . 

a stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) . 

goro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious . 

goro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen . 

the problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing . 

however , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy . 

this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems . 

take , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner . 

the price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum . 

tampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room . 

she protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists . 

just when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door . 

she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience . 

this scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery . 

there's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers . 

we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet . 

the scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all . 

there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives . 

a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor . 

surrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life . 

her husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner . 

the viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this . 

in a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family . 

as the family eats , she looks on them and smiles . 

preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy . 

then she falls over , dead . 

for a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , "" keep eating ! 

this is the last meal your mother ever made ! "" 

crying as they do so , the family finishes the meal . 

the scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful . 

by including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline . 

instead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo's goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble . 

because the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the "" good guys "" come together for the final showdown . 

in this case , the showdown is against the ramen . 

if they eat tampopo's ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded . 

it's pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack .

now she makes her directorial debut , writing , directing , and starring in this sub-par film about women talking about sex . 

though not without redeeming qualities , this film is bad . 

the basic story follows three single friends -- jazz ( beyer ) , lena ( randi ingerman ) , and michelle ( paget brewster ) -- in their search for love . 

jazz has an idea for a local talk show ; it would feature women talking about sex and dating . 

she and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami . 

the film itself is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sprinkled</node> with these real interviews throughout , both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters . 

the fact that they are real provides a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">refreshing</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">break</node> from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film . 

there are several moments of bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">overextension</node> . 

in a low-budget independent film from a first-time director , these faults can sometimes be forgiven , if the screenplay is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fresh</node> and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">solid</node> . 

that is not the case here . 

the script <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">suffers</node> from random plot developments . 

there are four or five of these <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">turns</node> in the plot , each one <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">raising</node> the question "" where did that come from ? "" 

at one <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">point</node> , a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother . 

we are supposed to be <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">moved</node> , but since the scene is completely <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">un-led-up to</node> , we really don't care if she and her mother get along . 

we've never seen her mother before . 

we never see her again . 

who cares ? 

what's worse , these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy . 

at another <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">point</node> , a character announces that she can't have children . 

apparently , this is devastating . 

we wouldn't know this because she never talked about having kids before , but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her . 

the scene feels like an afterthought , its emotion manipulative and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">shallow</node> . 

these scenes <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">grow</node> worse and worse , culminating in an absurd <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">climax</node> . 

two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing . 

one scene is a lover's spat between two minor characters . 

the other has the main characters expressing their <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">copious</node> grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax . 

thinking on these scenes , it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities . 

but it does . 

first , it is original . 

we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups , and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea . 

it's something i don't think has been the subject of a film . 

second , the interviews of the miami women are sincere . 

taken together , they form a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">mosaic picture</node> of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners . 

the mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes , but each <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">tile</node> is some woman's real experience . 

neither the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">picture</node> of women , nor their <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">picture</node> of men , is truly representative , but the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">point</node> is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way . 

at some level , the stereotypes that emerge can be called true . 

i can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their "" likes , dislikes , skills , and thrills , "" but on the whole , it's pretty bad . 

and that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">overextension</node> . 

i'll give beyer <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">one more strike , and then she's out</node> .

the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill . 

duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men . 

his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause . 

his pain creates pain for the viewer . 

however , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film . 

the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at "" the jerry springer show . "" 

the scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks . 

not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief . 

as the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction . 

his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing . 

greene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don't even see him walk the infamous green mile . 

however , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting . 

the speed in "" the green mile "" is perfect . 

if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others . 

the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character . 

 "" the green mile "" is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene . 

 fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing . 

if you survive the first third of "" the green mile "" sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment .

but once again , his character was given some pretty bad dialogue , and didn't react too logically to many of the situations . 

there was very little logical development in these characters .

43C2B138-1F40-455B-9DD6-98D135D6375B,"the ultimate <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">match up</node> between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">looks</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">deeper</node> into an already examined rivalry . 

based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fits</node> together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . 

the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . 

elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . 

however , as ness soon learns , in order to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">stabilize</node> peace , you have to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bend</node> a few laws . 

the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . 

the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">following</node> all laws . 

the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . 

from this <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">point</node> we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . 

right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . 

this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced . 

i found this <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">approach</node> to be very clever because in a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">small</node> duration of time there is a great <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">amount</node> of admiration for ness and an equal <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">amount</node> of hatred for capone . 

the film only gets better from this <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">point</node> . 

with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . 

they walk in unison and they only look forward . 

as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . 

holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . 

one that comes to mind is "" the matrix "" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . 

wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless . 

 "" the untouchables "" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . 

the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army . 

each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">separated</node> them from others . 

elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">grows</node> during the course of the film . 

he begins as a man who is determined to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">follow</node> all laws no matter how unfair they may be . 

however , as the film <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">develops</node> so does ness . 

his beliefs involving the law are <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">shattered</node> when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">side</node> . 

he also begins to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">lose</node> his <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">stability</node> when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . 

his anger becomes so <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">thunderous</node> that he can no longer <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hold</node> it in . 

sean connery , who won an academy award for best <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">supporting</node> actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">run</node> as a member of the untouchables . 

malone acts as a mentor to ness . 

he teaches him "" the chicago way "" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun . 

connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed . 

andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer . 

as ness <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">grows</node> , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him . 

charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone . 

smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">relief</node> to the film . 

the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . 

also very similar to "" the matrix , "" they are exciting and intense . 

>from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed . 

the score during these scenes ingeniously <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">adds</node> to the excitement . 

its <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pounding</node> drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors . 

the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective . 

although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">contains</node> a unique <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">blend</node> of great acting , great directing , and great action . 

some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">stuck</node> in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">vivid</node> . 

","the ultimate <Metaphor> match up </Metaphor> between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it <Metaphor> looks </Metaphor> <Metaphor> deeper </Metaphor> into an already examined rivalry . 

based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it <Metaphor> fits </Metaphor> together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . 

the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . 

elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . 

however , as ness soon learns , in order to <Metaphor> stabilize </Metaphor> peace , you have to <Metaphor> bend </Metaphor> a few laws . 

the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . 

the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in <Metaphor> following </Metaphor> all laws . 

the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . 

from this <Metaphor> point </Metaphor> we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . 

right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . 

this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced . 

i found this <Metaphor> approach </Metaphor> to be very clever because in a <Metaphor> small </Metaphor> duration of time there is a great <Metaphor> amount </Metaphor> of admiration for ness and an equal <Metaphor> amount </Metaphor> of hatred for capone . 

the film only gets better from this <Metaphor> point </Metaphor> . 

with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . 

they walk in unison and they only look forward . 

as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . 

holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . 

one that comes to mind is "" the matrix "" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . 

wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless . 

 "" the untouchables "" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . 

the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army . 

each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that <Metaphor> separated </Metaphor> them from others . 

elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely <Metaphor> grows </Metaphor> during the course of the film . 

he begins as a man who is determined to <Metaphor> follow </Metaphor> all laws no matter how unfair they may be . 

however , as the film <Metaphor> develops </Metaphor> so does ness . 

his beliefs involving the law are <Metaphor> shattered </Metaphor> when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other <Metaphor> side </Metaphor> . 

he also begins to <Metaphor> lose </Metaphor> his <Metaphor> stability </Metaphor> when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . 

his anger becomes so <Metaphor> thunderous </Metaphor> that he can no longer <Metaphor> hold </Metaphor> it in . 

sean connery , who won an academy award for best <Metaphor> supporting </Metaphor> actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final <Metaphor> run </Metaphor> as a member of the untouchables . 

malone acts as a mentor to ness . 

he teaches him "" the chicago way "" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun . 

connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed . 

andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer . 

as ness <Metaphor> grows </Metaphor> , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him . 

charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone . 

smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic <Metaphor> relief </Metaphor> to the film . 

the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . 

also very similar to "" the matrix , "" they are exciting and intense . 

>from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed . 

the score during these scenes ingeniously <Metaphor> adds </Metaphor> to the excitement . 

its <Metaphor> pounding </Metaphor> drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors . 

the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective .

a vicious serial killer named carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has been kidnapping women , locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days , then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life-sized dolls . 

just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell , stargher has a traumatic experience that <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">triggers </node>a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sink</node> in an eternal catatonia . 

the police , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">led</node> by fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim's body , but they feel all hope is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">lost</node> for his current victim due to his <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">vegetative</node> state . 

in a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">last ditch</node> attempt , they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">entering</node> stargher's mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell . . .

the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">buzz</node> around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m .

despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">contains</node> several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery . 

all of the sequences where we <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">delve</node> into someone's mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">dank</node> mind of stargher , whose thoughts <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video</node> ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">lead</node> us to believe . 

the first sequence that takes place in stargher's mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">traps</node> i've ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">zoo-like</node> display of stargher's victims which are <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">animated like marionettes</node> , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room . 

if the film had continued within this <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">dirty</node> monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) . 

the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">parade</node> of images , but at least vincent d'onofrio <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">turns</node> in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">magnified by ten</node> , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) . 

in my opinion , d'onofrio was one of the best <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">creepy</node> actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . - 

the newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him . 

the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him . 

detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">stay far away</node> from this film , as it contains <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">heavy doses</node> of both . 

besides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher's penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">recoiling</node> . 

a sequence where catherine enters stargher's mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">disquieting</node> .

as a narrative film , the cell is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sorely</node> lacking . 

as a collection of images though , the cell is extremely well done .

it offered no blair witches or sixth senses ; the best <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">big</node> budget hollywood could do was an efficient x-men adaptation and a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">flawed</node> but entertaining shaft update . 

nurse betty <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">signals</node> the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">brighter</node> fall movie season , that <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">battery-charging</node> ( at least for critics who have to sit through every <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">piece o' shit</node> that <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">moseys</node> into multiplexes ) time of year when all those oscar contenders ( read : "" quality "" films ) <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">compete</node> for audiences . 

alas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">junk heap</node> of the new season . 

it's also indie director neil labute's first attempt at something <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">resembling</node> a mainstream picture , and i'm sad to report it's a resounding failure ( at least on this web site ) , a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">mess</node> that's as hopelessly <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">saccharine</node> as people have accused labute's previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic . 

i went in expecting something decent , for betty was gleefully praised , it's screenplay even winning an award at cannes , but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment . 

are critics so desperate for something unique that they're <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">blind</node> to how derivative the particular <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">brand</node> of "" uniqueness "" betty <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">dolls out</node> is ? 

for the first time labute is working from a script he has not written , and he seems unsure of how to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">handle the material</node> . 

betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction ( this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bright</node> and articulate hit men ) , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">enchanting</node> like the wizard of oz ( of which this film makes several allusions to ) and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">heartwarming</node> like [<node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">stick in</node> your favorite loveable misfit movie] , but by the end it left me <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">cold</node> with its <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">calculated</node> desperation . 

it's labute's <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">half hearted</node> attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesn't even seem to have <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">half that heart</node> in it . 

nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict , betty ( brilliantly played by renee zellweger ) , who witnesses the killing of her husband , del ( aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife ) by two hit men ( morgan freeman and chris rock ) . 

she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">merges</node> the two realities . 

she's <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">blocked out</node> her husband's death and thinks she's a character in her favorite soap , a reason to love . 

betty sets out on the road to la ( with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk ) searching for her soap boyfriend dr . david ravell ( greg kinnear ) while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit . 

the labute who <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">birthed</node> the extraordinary in the company of men , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">slipped</node> a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bit</node> ( but not much ) with his <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sophomore</node> effort , your friends and neighbors , then <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fell straight on his ass</node> with bash , a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime . 

the play demonstrated no <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">forward movement</node> as an artist , only labute's persistence in <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">wallowing</node> in the horrid <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">things</node> "" average "" people do to each other , usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are . 

in the play , paul rudd , as an obnoxious jock , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">delivers</node> a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death , while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim "" boys will be boys "" . 

another character , schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby ! 

what was once so <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">powerful</node> about labute's work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">elements</node> we all have in us <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">amplified</node> to a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">disgusting</node> degree ) had become so <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">over the top</node> it was <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">borderline</node> comic . 

obviously , at this <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">point</node> , labute could use a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">dose</node> of some different kind of <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">material</node> before he <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pigeon holes</node> himself <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">further</node> , but nurse betty isn't it . 

he clearly has little passion for what he's doing here , instead replacing his mojo with <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">strained</node> quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn't managed to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">transcend</node> that ) <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">tailor made</node> to appeal to the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">widest</node> possible audience . 

nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fatally</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">slows the picture down</node> , as the two are made to enact <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">soft-boiled</node> tarantino-esque dialogue . 

they evince little <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">chemistry</node> , with rock constantly in <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">over the top</node> rant <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">mode</node> , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that's represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) . 

i think rock is a great comic yet he hasn't been able to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bring</node> his <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">feral</node> intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it's like he's doing the damn chris rock show . 

surprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">apple pie</node> looks . 

that <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">wide-open</node> face and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">helium voiced</node> earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty-year-old body . 

it's the best work she's ever done . 

freeman is effective as always , though his performance nonetheless <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">suffers</node> because it seems <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">at odds</node> with where the movie wants to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">take</node> it . 

the actor plays the role in his usual calm , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">collected</node> manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty's , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality . 

that's interesting but the movie doesn't do anything with it other than <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">crash land</node> the sub-theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle . 

the film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie's in trouble when the score <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sticks out</node> as one of the best things about it ) but nothing <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">jells</node> , it's parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">opposing</node> . 

the film might have worked had it <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">settled on</node> being one type of film , a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">mainstream</node> , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if it <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">falls as flat as diet coke</node> . 

betty's screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty wouldn't make any progress in the film . 

nurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim's wound because she happened to see how on tv , which <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">leads to</node> her being offered a room with the victim's girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ? a little too <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">tidy</node> , don'tcha think . 

betty has an interesting theme , though <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">it doesn't even seem aware</node> of this . 

the current state of tv has been <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">leaning towards</node> reality television what with the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">enormous</node> success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way . 

this is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real-life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) . 

instead of <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">exploring</node> this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the '80s than the '00s ) , the film simply uses betty's delusions as a plot device to get her from <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">point a to b</node> . no progress is made and little is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">unearthed</node> except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation .

4BE35E22-2821-423B-ACD6-98D13B1149B3,"i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years . 

it was a period that would mercilessly <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">force</node> me to <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">exit</node> boyhood and <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">thrust me</node> into the <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">unwelcome arms</node> of adulthood . 

but of all the experiences that i <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">collected</node> throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">toughest</node> and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">raging</node> hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex . 

yes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hounded</node> me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">like trying to fight an invisible monster</node> . 

for all teenagers , it's almost like a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">rite of passage</node> . 

and what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking . 

and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">brought to light</node> in what might be the funniest movie this summer . 

`american pie' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">enter into</node> a pact to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">lose</node> their virginity by the end of the school year . 

just how great are their hormones raging ? 

one of them notes , after watching disney's the little mermaid , that ariel is soooo hot . 

the four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim . 

kevin is the only one with a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">steady</node> girlfriend , but doesn't want to have sex until the time is just right . 

but what is the perfect time ? 

there is just no way to know , and that frightens him . 

oz is the big jock who decides that the way to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">score</node> with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive . 

he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">getting in touch</node> with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages . 

finch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl . 

so , he pays someone $200 to start <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">spreading</node> rumors about his prowess . 

suddenly , girls are <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">lining up</node> to go out with him . 

but among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful . 

when he has a chance to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">romp with</node> a pretty exchange student , his inexperience <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">comes shining through</node> . 

he has much to learn , and will do anything to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">seek out</node> this kind of knowledge . 

this may include watching <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">scrambled</node> porn channels or experimenting with mom's apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny . 

the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating . 

there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there's something about mary' was gloriously ribald . 

in fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">cuts</node> finally <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">brought it down</node> to a teen-accessible rating . 

but i guess after seeing the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">no-holds-barred</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">coarseness</node> of south park , this seems <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">tame</node> by comparison . 

teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hardest</node> . 

but unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here . 

these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex . 

their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences . 

they know what they want , yet <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">temper</node> it with responsibility . 

but almost always , it's impossible to know how to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fight the invisible monster</node> , and it's these episodes that make `american pie' such a carnal delight to watch .

one of them notes , after watching disney's the little mermaid , that ariel is soooo hot . 

the four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim . 

kevin is the only one with a <Metaphor> steady </Metaphor> girlfriend , but doesn't want to have sex until the time is just right . 

but what is the perfect time ? 

there is just no way to know , and that frightens him . 

oz is the big jock who decides that the way to <Metaphor> score </Metaphor> with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive . 

he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that <Metaphor> getting in touch </Metaphor> with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages . 

finch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl . 

so , he pays someone $200 to start <Metaphor> spreading </Metaphor> rumors about his prowess . 

suddenly , girls are <Metaphor> lining up </Metaphor> to go out with him . 

but among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful . 

when he has a chance to <Metaphor> romp with </Metaphor> a pretty exchange student , his inexperience <Metaphor> comes shining through </Metaphor> . 

he has much to learn , and will do anything to <Metaphor> seek out </Metaphor> this kind of knowledge . 

this may include watching <Metaphor> scrambled </Metaphor> porn channels or experimenting with mom's apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny . 

the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating . 

there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there's something about mary' was gloriously ribald . 

in fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more <Metaphor> cuts </Metaphor> finally <Metaphor> brought it down </Metaphor> to a teen-accessible rating . 

but i guess after seeing the <Metaphor> no-holds-barred </Metaphor> <Metaphor> coarseness </Metaphor> of south park , this seems <Metaphor> tame </Metaphor> by comparison . 

teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh <Metaphor> hardest </Metaphor> . 

but unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here . 

these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex . 

their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences . 

they know what they want , yet <Metaphor> temper </Metaphor> it with responsibility . 

but almost always , it's impossible to know how to <Metaphor> fight the invisible monster </Metaphor> , and it's these episodes that make `american pie' such a carnal delight to watch . 

","i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years . 

it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood . 

but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex . 

yes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster . 

for all teenagers , it's almost like a rite of passage . 

and what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking . 

and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer .

5A504E80-D58A-4367-83D6-98D1385EA55B,"one of the last entries in the long-running carry on series , carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">descending on</node> a 'caravan' site . 

professors anna vrooshka ( elke sommer ) and roland crump ( kenneth williams ) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep ( kenneth connor ) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains . 

anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">get the wrong end of the stick</node> : - for instance , when anna is asking for 'scrubbers for dirty caravan' , she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan ! 

arthur upmore ( bernard bresslaw ) and his wife linda ( patsy rowlands ) take her mother daphne barnes ( joan sims ) and her minah bird on holiday with them . 

mother-in-law jokes prevail . 

furthermore , the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families . 

fred ramsden ( windsor davies ) and ernie bragg ( jack douglas ) leave their wives ( liz fraser and patricia franklin ) behind for a fishing holiday . 

however , they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls , sandra ( carol hawkins ) and carol ( sherrie hewson ) . 

the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day-to-day running of the camp , the search for the minah bid and greyhound , the major , fred and ernie's desperate need of a woman , a misunderstanding <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">leading</node> to a striptease at the caravan park's pub , and a shock <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">in store</node> for daphne . 

the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing . 

this is what <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">binds the movie together</node> .

where the original had comedy , the sequel has the kind of <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">revolting</node> silliness that can be found in tv sit-coms . 

where the first installment had <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">chills</node> , this one has sequences that are inappropriately , unintentionally funny . 

in short , while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre , the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax ( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity ) . 

the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans -- andy ( tom everett scott ) , brad ( vince vieluf ) , and chris ( phil buckman ) -- sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping . 

soon they have company in the person of serafine ( julie delpy ) , who has decided to end it all . 

she jumps , but andy , with a bungee cord attached , goes after her , and manages to save her ( at the price of a major headache ) . 

serafine disappears , but a smitten andy seeks her out . 

however , once he learns his would-be girlfriend's <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">dark</node> secret , he wishes he hadn't . 

she's a werewolf , cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full , and , to make matters worse , he has suffered a nasty bite himself . 

actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie . 

she <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">imbues</node> serafine with <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">spirit</node> , spunk , and humanity , which gives us an emotional <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">stake</node> in the character's fate . 

this isn't necessarily a good thing , since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">mindless</node> , campy entertainment experience . 

delpy's <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">injection</node> of class into an otherwise classless production <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">raises the specter</node> of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">surrounding</node> her . 

delpy's previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski's white and richard linklater's before sunrise . 

she was <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">radiant</node> , charismatic , and effective in both . 

given the nature and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">level</node> of the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">material</node> she has to work with here , she gets as <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">close</node> as possible to those adjectives . 

it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris , but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss . 

and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff , check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice -- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts . 

the rest of the cast acts at <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">a level considerably below</node> that of delpy -- which is to say , they give performances appropriate for the screenplay . 

tom everett scott ( that thing you do ) plays the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">lead</node> like he's in a made-for-tv movie . 

it would be kind to call him bland . 

actors vince vieluf and phil buckman , as andy's friends , are no more impressive . 

julie bowen ( happy gilmore ) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat . 

and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">turn</node> as another monster meal . 

on the technical side , it's all <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bad news</node> . 

the computer-generated werewolves look <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">painfully</node> unreal . 

the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits . 

repeated use is made of the "" werewolf cam "" , an infrared wolf's point-of-view <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">approach</node> that's interesting the first couple of times it's employed , then becomes tedious . 

and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">clash violently</node> with the on-screen action they're matched to . 

director anthony waller , who displayed a confident , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">edgy</node> style in mute witness , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">stumbles</node> with this <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">material</node> , never being able to make the comedy and horror <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">elements</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">gel</node> . 

as a result , we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii : your sister is a werewolf . 

 ( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog , though -- something that's rarely seen in movies these days . ) an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a "" bad movie "" sort of way , but that's a dubious distinction . 

ultimately , it's an unfortunate effort , for , while it isn't unbearable to sit through , it isn't a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">howl</node> , either .

","an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis' 1981 feature , an american werewolf in london . 

where the original had comedy , the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit-coms . 

where the first installment had chills , this one has sequences that are inappropriately , unintentionally funny . 

in short , while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre , the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax ( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity ) . 

the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans -- andy ( tom everett scott ) , brad ( vince vieluf ) , and chris ( phil buckman ) -- sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping . 

soon they have company in the person of serafine ( julie delpy ) , who has decided to end it all . 

she jumps , but andy , with a bungee cord attached , goes after her , and manages to save her ( at the price of a major headache ) . 

serafine disappears , but a smitten andy seeks her out . 

however , once he learns his would-be girlfriend's dark secret , he wishes he hadn't . 

she's a werewolf , cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full , and , to make matters worse , he has suffered a nasty bite himself . 

actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie . 

she imbues serafine with spirit , spunk , and humanity , which gives us an emotional stake in the character's fate . 

this isn't necessarily a good thing , since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless , campy entertainment experience . 

delpy's injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her . 

delpy's previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski's white and richard linklater's before sunrise . 

she was radiant , charismatic , and effective in both . 

given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here , she gets as close as possible to those adjectives . 

it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris , but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss . 

and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff , check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice -- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts .

while the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">tongue-in-cheek</node> , parodic <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">element</node> is still noticeable in this film , it's really a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sideshow</node> to a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">broader</node> commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . 

the first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant . 

the premise of "" scream 2 "" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called "" stab , "" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in "" scream , "" is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">released</node> and two audience members are killed during the opening screening . 

i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy . 

its conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it's a publicity stunt , is more surreal and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">disturbing</node> than anything else . 

the satire in "" scream 2 "" thus takes on a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">broad</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">focus</node> and gradually <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">evolves</node> into an <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">exploration</node> of media perceptions in general . 

although resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fresh</node> dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">drawing from</node> other <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">entries in the pop culture encyclopedia</node> as well . 

everything from "" friends "" and "" saved by the bell "" to "" showgirls "" and "" terminator 2 "" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren't any "" wes carpenter "" jokes this time . 

more importantly , this film portrays characters willing to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">go to disturbing lengths</node> for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">clearly</node> been <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">warped</node> by what they have seen on tv and film . 

the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from "" scream "" ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">defense</node> ) , weathers <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">exploits</node> the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine's life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show . 

understandably , "" scream 2 "" does not <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">go so far</node> as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sick</node> and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">twisted</node> . 

<node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">couple that</node> with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">lead</node> character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">well-developed</node> and that there are some genuine moments of <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">spine-chilling</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">suspense</node> , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right . 

we don't just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bites the dust</node> ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">lurking around the corner</node> . 

while i have not seen any of his other work , it's easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated "" slasher film "" director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing . 

unfortunately , "" scream 2 "" occasionally <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">reverts to</node> the time-honored horror tradition of <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">throwing logic out the window</node> . 

for example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion . 

there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction . 

as for the question of whether or not "" scream 2 "" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor . 

 . 

 . 

well , it's hard to say . 

i gave the first "" scream "" 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">light-hearted</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">send-up</node> . 

 "" scream 2 "" <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bounces all over the place</node> stylistically , but it does a better job <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">delivering</node> the genuine scares and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">asking the questions</node> about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment . 

i'm not sure which is the better movie , but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels , however much randy might argue , do not necessarily <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">suck</node> . 

","only a year after the initial <Metaphor> release </Metaphor> of "" scream , "" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to <Metaphor> breathe new life </Metaphor> into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel "" scream 2 "" has arrived in our theaters .

i'm not sure which is the better movie , but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels , however much randy might argue , do not necessarily <Metaphor> suck </Metaphor> . 

","only a year after the initial release of "" scream , "" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel "" scream 2 "" has arrived in our theaters . 

while the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it's really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . 

the first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant . 

the premise of "" scream 2 "" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called "" stab , "" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in "" scream , "" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening . 

i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy . 

its conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it's a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else . 

the satire in "" scream 2 "" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general .

the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality . 

how exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind ? 

and if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in , would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion ? 

unfortunately , the matrix doesn't provide many answers to the questions it raises , but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions , shoot-outs , and flying roundhouse kicks . 

perhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving , who plays agent smith , the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix . 

weaving's stony appearance , deadpan voice , and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting , evil technological force that controls the matrix . 

like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t-1000 terminator in terminator 2 : judgement day , weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because , despite his power and seeming invincibility , he looks ordinary , even scrawny . 

weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence . 

the film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography . 

it seems to be deliberately kitchy , with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors . 

in a few scenes , the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny . 

just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring . 

however , with the comic-book style and tone of the film , you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience . 

the matrix isn't a classic . 

its open-ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers . 

it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions . 

it also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero - the kind of shmaltzy feel-good goo that most of the film avoids . 

reportedly , the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel . 

unfortunately , audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future . 

the matrix is an fun , enjoyable diversion , like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival . 

just don't be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry .

the movie <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">opens</node> with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . 

then it <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">comes</node> , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score . 

dah-dum . 

from there , director steven spielberg <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">wastes</node> no time , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">taking</node> us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . 

right away he lets us know <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean</node> , and <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">once "" jaws "" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip</node> . 

perhaps what is most <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">outstanding</node> about "" jaws "" is how spielberg <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">builds</node> the movie . 

he <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">works it</node> like a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">theatrical production</node> , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">with a first act and a second act</node> . 

unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">restraint</node> , and refuses to show us the shark until the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">middle </node>of the second act . 

until then , he merely <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">suggests</node> its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music . 

he's <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">building</node> the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">tension</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bit by bit</node> , so when it <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">comes</node> time for the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">climax</node> , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying . 

he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery . 

the first act <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">opens</node> with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . 

the island is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">shaken up</node> by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">shut down</node> the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . 

brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . 

hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">workings</node> of the shark ( "" it's a <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">perfect engine</node> , an <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">eating machine</node> "" ) make it that much more terrifying . 

when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">crusty</node> old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . 

the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . 

 "" jaws "" is a thriller with a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">keen</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sense of humor</node> and an incredible <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sense of pacing</node> , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">tension</node> , and horror . 

it is like ten movies all <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">rolled into one</node> , and it's no wonder it <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">took america by storm</node> in the summer of 1975 , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">taking in</node> enough money to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">crown</node> it the box office <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">champ</node> of all time ( until it was <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">unceremoniously dethroned</node> in 1977 by "" star wars "" ) . 

even today , fascination with this film is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">on par </node>with hitchcock's "" psycho , "" and it never seems to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">age</node> . 

although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">lead to</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">overkill</node> . 

the technical limitations <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">faced</node> by spielberg in 1975 may have actually <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">produced</node> a better film because it <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">forced</node> him to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">rely on</node> traditional cinematic <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">elements</node> like <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pacing</node> , characterization , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sharp</node> editing , and creative photography , instead of simply <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">dousing</node> the audience with digital shark effects . 

scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time "" jaws "" was made , but none of them had the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">draw</node> of a robert redford or paul newman . 

nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">outstanding</node> performance and refused to be <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">overshadowed</node> by the shark . 

scheider <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hits just the right notes</node> as a sympathetic husband and father <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">caught</node> in the political <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">quagmire</node> of doing what's right and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">going against</node> the entire town . 

 "" it's your first summer here , you know , "" mayor vaughn warns him . 

dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in "" american graffiti "" ( 1973 ) and "" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz "" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . 

however , most <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">outstanding</node> is the <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">gnarled</node> performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sorely</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">overlooked</node> by the academy awards . 

<node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bordering</node> of parody , shaw plays quint as a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">grizzled</node> old loner whose machismo <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">borders on</node> masochism . 

he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature . 

however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . 

quint is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">drawn into</node> telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . 

indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . 

his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hair-raising</node> than anything spielberg put on screen . 

shaw <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">delivers</node> the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . 

of course , we can't <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">leave out</node> the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . 

a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in "" jaws , "" and they are a threat . 

every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bunch</node> of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . 

the shark in "" jaws "" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed "" bruce "" by the crew ) built to be <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">shot</node> from different angles . 

many have forgotten , but "" jaws "" was a sort of precursor to "" waterworld "" ( 1995 ) , a movie's who <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">soggy</node> production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bomb</node> . 

but , as we can see now , spielberg <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">overcame</node> all the obstacles , and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">delivered</node> one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">come out</node> of hollywood .

but , as we can see now , spielberg <Metaphor> overcame </Metaphor> all the obstacles , and <Metaphor> delivered </Metaphor> one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to <Metaphor> come out </Metaphor> of hollywood .

",""" jaws "" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . 

the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . 

then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score . 

dah-dum . 

from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . 

right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once "" jaws "" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . 

perhaps what is most outstanding about "" jaws "" is how spielberg builds the movie . 

he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . 

unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . 

until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music . 

he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying . 

he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery . 

the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . 

the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . 

brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . 

hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( "" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine "" ) make it that much more terrifying . 

when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . 

the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . 

 "" jaws "" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . 

it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by "" star wars "" ) . 

even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's "" psycho , "" and it never seems to age .

a stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir's witness , belongs to the latter category . 

the heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">tough</node> lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york . 

during one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed . 

in order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community . 

emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder . 

concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover . 

that isn't easy , because her modern manners are <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">colliding</node> with traditionalist <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">ways</node> . 

things get even more complicated when she <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">develops</node> feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) . 

using peter weir's formula isn't the greatest <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">flaw</node> of this film . 

even the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">lame</node> and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent . 

but the worst <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">insult</node> to viewer's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith .

85A86592-1E05-42D0-A0D6-98D13FBFA2B4,"as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet . 

i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">biggest </node>paid commercial for america online . 

and i wonder : is that so bad ? 

well , the commercial part is . 

as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i'll be okay . 

to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act . 

they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">triumph</node> in philadelphia , i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious . 

tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going to get the girl : the only question is how ? 

meg ryan , america's high school <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sweetheart</node> , can act . 

she's had a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">handful</node> of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don't , get the movie-- fantastic ) . 

but , i like her best when she's , well , perky . 

she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">short</node> lifetime . 

some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don't really know . 

all i know is that i just like them both . 

they have such wonderfully <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">kinetic</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">chemistry</node> that's really hard to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">resist </node>, and i'm not going to even try . 

they're just really , really cute , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sweet </node>, and charming . 

hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">megahit</node> sleepless in seattle . 

here , the setup is a little different . 

kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children's bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">passed down</node> to her . 

she is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) . 

she is also having an affair , of sorts . 

you see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152 . 

they have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is . 

ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman ) . 

fox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children's bookseller named "" shop around the corner "" , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly . 

every morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fight "" to the death</node> ! ! "" . 

it's a charming premise , and one that works nicely , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">balancing</node> the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have . 

it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no "" let's have sex tonight "" mantra , if you'll excuse my <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bluntness</node> . 

this is a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">solid</node> romance <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">built around</node> that <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">vague</node> concept of love . 

hmm . well , the movie <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">goes through</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">twists</node> and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">turns </node>, having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan "" <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hook up</node> "" , to use modern terminology , and <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">kiss their way into happiness</node> . 

you know it's going to happen , the question is now ? 

thankfully , ephron has a wonderful <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">supporting</node> cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sweet</node> kids . 

it's all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good . 

hanks is as obnoxious as ever <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">on the outside</node> and as <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">warm on the inside</node> as he always is . 

he is , i believe , america's greatest actor . 

does he show it here ? 

nah . 

but he's still tom hanks , and she's still meg ryan . 

which is what this movie <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">boils down</node> to . 

it's pure <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">confection</node> . 

all the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it's all really <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sweet</node> . 

there are some immense <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">flaws</node> , like <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pacing </node>. 

the last third of the movie really doesn't work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it's <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">slow</node> . 

once hanks knows the secret , it gets really <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">slow</node> . 

i even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">deliver</node> the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">big</node> onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour . 

the other problem is that this movie is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">shaping up</node> to be really dated . 

e-mail ? 

when my kids are my age , i don't know what we'll be using . 

but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history . 

they just work together , and it's nice to see . 

it gives you , well , a smile . 

the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake . 

i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was . 

i've always believed that movies are very <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">powerful</node> , very <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">powerful</node> indeed . 

you see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate . 

movies can definitely do the first two , and as for the third , well , i'd rather not think about that . 

i always thought films that made you think <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">enlightened</node> you and made you <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">see</node> something from another <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">viewpoint</node> , and that films that entertained you were good , because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night . 

and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had . 

hanks was the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">driving force</node> behind one of the year's best films in saving private ryan , which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world . 

he's also half of the <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">glue </node>behind the year's best example of pure entertainment . 

tom hanks and meg ryan are <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">magical</node> , as is this movie . 

it's a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sweet </node>, lovely affair with a technology <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">twist</node> . 

it may be a long commercial , but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face .

does he show it here ? 

nah . 

but he's still tom hanks , and she's still meg ryan . 

which is what this movie <Metaphor> boils down </Metaphor> to . 

it's pure <Metaphor> confection </Metaphor> . 

all the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it's all really <Metaphor> sweet </Metaphor> . 

there are some immense <Metaphor> flaws </Metaphor> , like <Metaphor> pacing </Metaphor> . 

the last third of the movie really doesn't work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it's <Metaphor> slow </Metaphor> . 

once hanks knows the secret , it gets really <Metaphor> slow </Metaphor> . 

i even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to <Metaphor> deliver </Metaphor> the <Metaphor> big </Metaphor> onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour . 

the other problem is that this movie is <Metaphor> shaping up </Metaphor> to be really dated . 

e-mail ? 

when my kids are my age , i don't know what we'll be using . 

but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history . 

they just work together , and it's nice to see . 

it gives you , well , a smile . 

the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake . 

i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was . 

i've always believed that movies are very <Metaphor> powerful </Metaphor> , very <Metaphor> powerful </Metaphor> indeed . 

you see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate . 

movies can definitely do the first two , and as for the third , well , i'd rather not think about that . 

i always thought films that made you think <Metaphor> enlightened </Metaphor> you and made you <Metaphor> see </Metaphor> something from another <Metaphor> viewpoint </Metaphor> , and that films that entertained you were good , because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night . 

and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had . 

hanks was the <Metaphor> driving force </Metaphor> behind one of the year's best films in saving private ryan , which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world . 

he's also half of the <Metaphor> glue </Metaphor> behind the year's best example of pure entertainment . 

tom hanks and meg ryan are <Metaphor> magical </Metaphor> , as is this movie . 

it's a <Metaphor> sweet </Metaphor> , lovely affair with a technology <Metaphor> twist </Metaphor> . 

it may be a long commercial , but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face . 

","as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet . 

i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online . 

and i wonder : is that so bad ? 

well , the commercial part is . 

as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i'll be okay . 

to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act . 

they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious . 

tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going to get the girl : the only question is how ? 

meg ryan , america's high school sweetheart , can act . 

she's had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don't , get the movie-- fantastic ) . 

but , i like her best when she's , well , perky . 

she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime . 

some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don't really know . 

all i know is that i just like them both . 

they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that's really hard to resist , and i'm not going to even try . 

they're just really , really cute , sweet , and charming . 

hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle . 

here , the setup is a little different . 

kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children's bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her . 

she is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) . 

she is also having an affair , of sorts . 

you see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152 . 

they have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is . 

ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman ) . 

fox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children's bookseller named "" shop around the corner "" , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly . 

every morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight "" to the death ! ! "" . 

it's a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have . 

it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no "" let's have sex tonight "" mantra , if you'll excuse my bluntness . 

this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love . 

hmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan "" hook up "" , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness . 

you know it's going to happen , the question is now ? 

thankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids . 

it's all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good . 

hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is . 

he is , i believe , america's greatest actor . 

does he show it here ? 

nah . 

but he's still tom hanks , and she's still meg ryan . 

which is what this movie boils down to . 

it's pure confection . 

all the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it's all really sweet . 

there are some immense flaws , like pacing . 

the last third of the movie really doesn't work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it's slow . 

once hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow . 

i even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour .

modern society is now <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">inundated </node>with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes . 

the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">biggest</node> debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">reflects</node> it . 

 "" your friends and neighbors "" takes a different <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">approach</node> as it's a film that <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">revolves</node> almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pain</node> and pleasure even within a small <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">circle</node> of friends . 

one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">dissected</node> as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story . 

firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">supporting</node> characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras . 

everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">full-circle</node> back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative . 

but to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult . 

labute's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll . 

for the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic . 

another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">limited</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">focus</node> . 

we're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone's home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown . 

the film is a complete character study with the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">tight </node>, <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">intense </node>drama of the theater . 

no one plot <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">dominates</node> the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background . 

we're simply <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">dropped in</node> on the characters' lives and are expected to figure out the rest . 

the characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives . 

first there's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">going through</node> a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">dry spell</node> not unlike many other couples in other situations who don't know what they're problem is . 

barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn't have a lot of ambition - he just <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">follows</node> everyone else . 

mary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn't hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something . 

labute's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">light</node> on <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">chemistry</node> and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">connection </node>between the two . 

obviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hollow</node> . 

another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything . 

their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship . 

if only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area . 

it's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? 

what did they ever <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">see</node> in the other person to begin with ? 

labute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">payoff</node> than the process , it still makes for good drama , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">tension</node> , and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">manip ulation</node> so <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">intricate</node> and deceitful it's fascinating . 

two other characters act as <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">catalysts </node>, cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) . 

cary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word "" bastard . "" 

somehow he is able to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bend</node> women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way . 

he's the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he's secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him . 

patric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is . 

cheri is a character labute uses as a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">catalyst </node>to see how the other characters react to her . 

she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">brushing it off</node> as <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">small</node> talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another . 

she's a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sweet</node> woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable . 

i will not <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">reveal</node> who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others' action , as that's the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hook</node> of the film . 

the first two acts begin to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">set up</node> the characters and each's scenarios , but it's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . 

the result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">course</node> of actions is always fascinating . 

for a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character's guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them . 

one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be . 

since the characters only interact with each other there isn't much pop culture references , as almost everything has a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">deeper </node>philosophy behind it . 

are we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ? 

i don't know of anyone <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">going through</node> the same situations as these people . 

often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie . 

but what this film does have that the others don't is repercussions in the end . 

although the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren't immortal . 

in what way "" your friends and neighbors "" is supposed to work is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">open to</node> interpretation . 

it definitely has a lot to say about the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">price</node> that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">expanded</node> on that theme more specifically . 

still , it's an accomplishment in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">perspective</node> .

she's a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable . 

i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others' action , as that's the hook of the film . 

the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each's scenarios , but it's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . 

the result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . 

for a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character's guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them . 

one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be . 

since the characters only interact with each other there isn't much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it . 

are we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ? 

i don't know of anyone going through the same situations as these people . 

often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie . 

but what this film does have that the others don't is repercussions in the end . 

although the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren't immortal . 

in what way "" your friends and neighbors "" is supposed to work is open to interpretation . 

it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically . 

still , it's an accomplishment in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective .

she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond . 

almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past . 

rose's narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she didn't want to marry .

for them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life . 

for rose , she is sailing to her <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">doom</node> . 

the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love . 

it's the classic <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">wrong-side-of-the-tracks</node> story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches .

it's <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sweet</node> , and it didn't make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories .

most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on .

it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths . 

the best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">flash</node> back to the future . 

the crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose's story , now are totally <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">aborbed</node> by her .

88A09C56-C388-4048-AAD7-B39861ECCE94,"according to popular film opinion , a film's greatness is determined by time . 

take for example "" casablanca . "" 

great film , even today . 

it's still as <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">powerful</node> as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic . 

another example would be "" star wars , "" which had a very , very <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">healthy</node> box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before . 

but as i rewatched "" independence day "" when it came out on video after being the number one <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hit</node> of 1996 , i kinda felt like it wasn't as <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">cool</node> as when i had first seen it . 

i had liked it when i saw it the first time ( * * * was my original view ) and basically saw it as a good "" <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">escape</node> film . "" 

but when i rewatched it , i felt cheated . 

thus , the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">curse</node> of the "" event film . "" 

 "" independence day "" is like <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once</node> ( except for a couple <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">kids</node> - the critics , in this situation ) . 

but after a while , <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one</node> . 

well , <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">this kid</node> is the "" event film "" in my little analogy . 

and when i rewatched "" independence day , "" not only did it not look <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">cooler</node> at all on the big screen , but i felt insulted the whole time . 

there are too many <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">gaping craters</node> in the plot and you just aren't sure if it's comedy or hokey drama . 

one scene , you'll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch ; the next you'll see a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bunch</node> of military <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">uptight</node> guys walking around , saying corny lines . 

the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">barked like a junkyard dog</node> by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of "" glen or glenda ? "" 

now <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">this annoying kid's problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once</node> , he shows he has no <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">balls</node> .

what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ? 

did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ? 

when did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads . 

the only place to turn these days for an <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">honest</node> action film is towards the east -- and i don't mean new york city . 

get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown . 

stallone <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up</node> . 

a few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">gracefully exit</node> the roles that typecast him as an action monkey . 

that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul . 

stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">shaken off</node> the past . 

too bad get carter returns stallone to action , but <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges</node> . 

get carter is a simple story . 

stallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) . 

when frank's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">mushy</node> inside , thinks <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">foul play</node> is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented "" carter's way "" . 

he talks tough with his brother's wife , lends a helping had to his brother's daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee . 

carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">slimy</node> porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">tough</node> . 

carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">extract</node> proper revenge on the responsible parties . 

what a minute ! 

this sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey . 

better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off . 

actually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) . 

while stallone still <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">carries his own weight</node> here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose . 

throughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">tough</node> , while nobody is taking him seriously . 

his one-liners <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fall flat</node> , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character . 

there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">lends</node> a bizarre <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">tone</node> to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words . 

the biggest surprise in get carter is that the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">best job done</node> in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke . 

an amazing method actor in the eighties who <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fell into</node> drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">brings a dangerous sense of purpose</node> to his porn king character . 

he may not win any oscars , but he still <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">ranks highly</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">in my book</node> . 

get carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud . 

the only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting . 

never mind that it should never have been made at all .

first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . 

the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . 

you have to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">reach for </node>a larger audience . 

therefore , the movie is quite <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">user-friendly</node> . 

altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">behind</node> the looks many characters <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">exchange</node> . 

but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">background </node>info on what is going on . 

you will never feel <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera</node> . 

in any case , the answer is no . 

i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . 

however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">opening</node> weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . 

i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . 

everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . 

i know i am <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">going maybe a bit too far</node> to make my <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">point</node> but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . 

warning : major spoilers <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">follow</node> ! 

please do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about . 

you have been warned . 

the x-files is what a summer should be . 

exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . 

this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">the human equivalent of a wooden plank</node> . 

from start to finish , this movie <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">does not let go of you</node> . 

when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">deadly</node> use of sound from event horizon . 

this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . 

in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">out of the blue</node> . 

you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! 

the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . 

you know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? 

so yeah , the x-files is scary . 

and guess what ? 

you never even have to see the monster but your imagination <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">works overtime</node> and it sure <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">beats</node> having to watch a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">flawed</node> , computer generated , babyzilla , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">it looks like you could walk right through it</node> not even scarier than <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">your grandma in undies type of monster</node> . 

do not think that the x-files is a monster movie . 

in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . 

no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . 

scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . 

she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . 

no , this is mulder's time <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">in the spotlight</node> . 

by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder "" <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">showers</node> "" independence day . 

if you have not then i will not <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">spoil</node> it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be "" <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">showering</node> "" godzilla instead . 

to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">out there</node> . . . who 

cares ! ? 

if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? 

the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . 

the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . 

the script is <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">spotless</node> , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . 

if you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">clear</node> later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! 

unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . 

miss one vital <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">piece</node> of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . 

also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don't ! 

the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . 

there is no time to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">take a breather</node> between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? 

 ) the x-files does not need to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fill </node>scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . 

who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a "" <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">big</node> emotional scene "" between godzilla attacks ? 

so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">higher</node> on my list of movies i'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">by a nose</node> . 

but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . 

what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ?

it's good some .

hell yes ! 

strangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . 

it does not provide answers to the show's many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . 

rating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">jump right out of your seat</node> thrills , many "" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! "" 

moments , four "" holy shit , where the hell did that come from "" and one heck of an ending . 

you may wonder where this movie lost half a star . 

well , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . 

it's pretty obvious the film's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving .

this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . 

in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . 

you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! 

the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . 

you know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? 

so yeah , the x-files is scary . 

and guess what ? 

you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . 

do not think that the x-files is a monster movie . 

in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . 

no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . 

scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . 

she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . 

no , this is mulder's time in the spotlight . 

by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder "" showers "" independence day . 

if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be "" showering "" godzilla instead . 

to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who 

cares ! ? 

if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? 

the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . 

the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . 

the script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . 

if you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! 

unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . 

miss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . 

also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don't ! 

the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . 

there is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? 

 ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . 

who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a "" big emotional scene "" between godzilla attacks ? 

so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . 

but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . 

what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? 

 cool effects ? 

it's good some . 

pulse pounding ? 

hell yes ! 

strangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . 

it does not provide answers to the show's many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . 

rating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many "" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! "" 

moments , four "" holy shit , where the hell did that come from "" and one heck of an ending . 

you may wonder where this movie lost half a star . 

well , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . 

it's pretty obvious the film's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving .

although jeff rejects the offer ( he wants to stay with his car ) , amy agrees , hops into warren's lorry , and promptly disappears . 

jeff wonders where the hell she is , and when he later catches up with warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life , the plot <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">thickens</node> and jeff goes on a chase to find his wife . 

although comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance ( 1972 ) and the vanishing ( 1993 ) plot wise , the latter two are <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">far</node> superior character and script wise . 

kurt russell is o . k as jeff , although he can seemingly only <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pull of</node> one expression , which is angry .

quinlan is o . k again , but again she can only <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pull off</node> one expression , which is looking dorky . 

throughout the whole film , she looks dorky . 

j . t walsh ( who , sadly , recently <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">passed away</node> ) is fine as warren ( who we soon find out is a kidnapper ) although his actual character is pretty <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">weak</node> , and not really menacing enough . 

the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">supporting</node> cast do their best aswell , with rex linn as a doubting sheriff , and the other kidnappers . 

the story , written by first-timer jonathan mostow ( who also directs ) is o . k , if surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid . 

some of the things the characters do in this movie is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">beyond the bounds</node> of idiocy . 

there are some <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">flaws</node> with the plot also , as the characters do the complete opposite to logical ( presumably to keep the story 'exciting' ) and also the fact that the story just isn't <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">strong</node> enough to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sustain</node> the audience's attention .

<node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">it almost threatens to drop dead</node> . 

the picture does <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pick up</node> towards the end , but by then it's too late . 

mostow directs the action sequences well enough , however . 

the film doesn't really come to a satisfying conclusion , either . 

the ending <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">tries</node> to be <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bleak</node> , but just <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">comes off</node> annoying .

jim carrey does drama . 

when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , "" what a hilarious idea for a movie ! "" 

however , it was an even better premise for a drama . 

the truman show <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">takes us into a world</node> that <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">revolves</node> around one man . 

that man is truman burbank ( jim carrey ) . 

truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way . 

christof is the "" <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">god</node> "" of this made-up world . 

he <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">keeps everything running</node> and gives the actors their roles . 

there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal . 

the opening parts of the film introduce to truman's world . 

we see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past . 

it may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start . 

the film can be described in one word : weird . 

it seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did . 

it seems like a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">warped </node>idea , but it is andrew's idea and he did wonders with it . 

jim carrey actually lived up to the hype . 

the hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey's ability to do drama . 

no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey . 

and he showed them all up . 

jim carrey was <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">snubbed</node> at the oscars . 

i do not think he was the best actor , but he deserved the nomination . 

he plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">star</node> of the most popular television show in the world . 

he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years , but then strange things start happening . 

he ventures into the wrong elevator . 

a light crashes in front of him . 

his father comes back and is then pulled away . 

we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does not . 

and it is just a constant <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">progression</node> that never gets <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sluggish</node> . 

carrey is able to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">shed</node> his comedy to play a major role in a major drama . 

laura linney is magnificent as the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">camera hungry </node>wife . 

she plays her role as advertiser and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">budding</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">star</node> to a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">point</node> . 

peter weir does not make the cast perfect , and their <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">flaws </node>eventually <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">lead</node> to truman's escape . 

the story <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">unfolds</node> until the show becomes too <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">big </node>and everything <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">crashes down</node> . 

despite carrey's greatness , the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris , who plays the "" <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">god</node> "" of truman's world . 

he displays the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pressure</node> he is under , the world he has created . 

he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life . 

the action moves at a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">good pace</node> , and rarely gets <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sluggish </node>. 

but , the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show . 

it really makes you think . 

maybe your brother is an actor , maybe your best friend is in <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">heated </node>contract negotiations to stay on the show . 

some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking . 

or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman's arrival . 

and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon ( noah emmerich ) <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">delivers</node> his dramatic line . 

all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative . 

i was not only enjoying the film , i was overwhelmed by genius of it . 

overall , the truman show is one of the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">freshest </node>and innovative films to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">come out of</node> hollywood . 

jim carrey shows that he is not just a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">man of a million faces</node> , but a legitimate actor who could <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">go down</node> as one of the best . 

andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pulled it off </node>to perfection . 

the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film .

she follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck , where she handles a fallen knife ( like any stupid character ) and is spotted by the coast guard , who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening . 

nick is presumed dead , and although she pleads her innocence , libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband . 

now , please don't think i'm spoiling any vital plot details , because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans . 

if you haven't seen this preview , don't read any further . 

but seriously , the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg and douglas s . cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters . 

during the most vital scenes in the movie , i was anticipating every twist or `surprise' that eventually popped up on the screen . 

i imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals . 

most , unfortunately , will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production . 

one is tommy lee jones , who plays travis lehman , a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison . 

jones is always wonderful as an authority figure , and he's certainly familiar with this sort of role ( as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals ) . 

judd , as a likable heroin with gusto , also has a chance to flex her acting abilities . 

while emotionally unconvincing , the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role , perking up the movie like an injection of anti-depressant . 

the actors , and their relationship together , present the one-two punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely . 

and now , back to the plot . 

while behind bars , libby learns an interesting little bit of information : a person can't be convicted of the same crime twice . 

this law , called `double jeopardy' , could be her motive for hunting down her husband . . . 

who may still be alive . 

yes , you heard right . 

the movie degenerates into a cross-country chase , where everything you expect to happen . . . 

does . 

the final scenes , which could have redeemed the film , are poorly handled by director bruce beresford - whose previous work centers highly around drama ( driving miss daisy , paradise road ) . 

ironically , it is those elements - like the driving force of libby to reunite with her son - that don't quite work here . 

at least double jeopardy is paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars . 

unfortunately , jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive , and the real depth of his character is only skin deep . 

but he and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material , and both have some memorable comic moments . 

judd , in particular , has a hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her `parole officer' . 

hmmm . . . 

perhaps this would have made a good comedy . 

it is disappointing , because there are the makings of a competent action film here . 

it's nicely shot and choreographed in downtown vancouver , and will entertain those who aren't turned off by the woeful story-line . 

 ? tis a shame that double jeopardy is an adult thriller that wouldn't fool most children .

another <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">garbage</node> slasher flick , the only difference being that * this * one has a story ! 

the story , you ask ? 

well , a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">scumball </node>buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk . 

he takes it home , somehow getting it past customs : - ) and starts fiddling with it in his attic . 

lo and behold , after he takes it apart , three demons appear and start taking him apart , but with meat hooks . 

when they're finished , his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling . 

they botch up their cleanup job , however , and manage to leave his heart ( or some gland ; i didn't really recognize the organ ) under a floorboard . 

the guy's brother and his brother's wife appear at the door soon after , and decide to move in . 

they throw away <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">scumball's</node> belongings , and set up house .

she starts having some <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">wild</node> hallucinations . 

later , hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards ( slow-mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground--all from the tiny cut on his hand ) . 

said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball's organ . 

the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing . 

it establishes mind <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">contact</node> with wife , who agrees to help him get more blood , because she really wants to be <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">screwed</node> again . 

so , she helps him kill three businessmen . 

<node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">scumball</node> , at this time , gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back .

he finally gets some , though , but strangely enough , he ends up looking like his brother .

it suitable for everyone , so <Metaphor> put the guilt behind </Metaphor> , and put some more money into spielbergs bank account . 

you won't regret it . 

","swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults . 

steven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie . 

and he knows a money making winner when he sees one . 

the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster : big action , funny comedy , and the pacing of a rollercoaster . 

hopkins plays don diego de la vega , otherwise known as zorro . 

a fighter for the people , he is eventually captured by don rafael montero ( stuart wilson ) , who also , unintentionally , kills his wife . 

the film cuts to twenty years later , where vega still wants to montero dead . 

however , he's far too old now , and trains up thief alejandro murrieta ( banderas ) to become the new zorro . 

banderas motive ? 

to avenge the death of his brother , who was killed at the hands of captain love ( matthew letscher ) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar , in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie . 

with the scene set , the movie goes on full blast , with sword fights a-plenty and witty one liners . 

banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro's , playing each other off with ease . 

hopkins seems to come off a little better , but banderas does some excellent work . 

as the bad guys , wilson and letscher seem one dimensional , but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way . 

the audience does hate them , which can't be bad . 

catherine zeta-jones also pops up as hopkins daughter , and although she provides little more than the usual female lead , she delivers a charming , but one note , performance . 

the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones . 

there's a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight , and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed , until jones clothes fall off all together . 

the director , fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye ( 1995 ) handles the film perfectly . 

the action is well done and fast paced , the comedy put across well . 

the cast help a lot , but the direction is still outstanding . 

although the film is very long , the plot keeps chugging along , and there's barely a dull moment . 

however , the film is a little over indulgent , and it could have been trimmed . 

it manages to hold the attention , thankfully , and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel . 

screenwriters john eskow , ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script . 

although they've bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action , the plot itself is barely existent . 

there's lots of little sub plots hanging around , but there's nothing substantial to bring them all together . 

the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to 'buy' california using gold stolen from the guy he's buying the land off . 

this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines . 

however , this doesn't seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film , so the film is never quite sure where it's going . 

in the end however , zorro provides action and comedy in spades . 

it suitable for everyone , so put the guilt behind , and put some more money into spielbergs bank account . 

you won't regret it .

i really do like to read , and i've enjoyed many books in my lifetime . 

my problem is that i'm a slow reader , and not very dedicated -- i'll enjoy <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">portions</node> of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it's taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina , even though i'm loving the book ) . 

in addition to this , i typically don't read anything created after the 19th century . 

the only reason i bother with this <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bit</node> of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven't read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations ) . 

however , i don't think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film . 

needless to say , i haven't read the elmore leonard novel out of sight , on which steven soderbergh's new film is based . 

i can't say how faithful of an adaptation it is , or if it <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">lives up to</node> leonard's vision . 

i can say that it's a terrific film , with <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sharp</node> acting , great dialogue , and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pumping</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">full of</node> energy and style <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">injected</node> by soderbergh . 

it's certainly a nice distraction from 1998's <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">lineup</node> of brainless blockbusters , all hopelessly wishing that size mattered . 

out of sight proves that it doesn't . 

i had originally <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">written george clooney off</node> as a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">one-note</node> actor , incapable of <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">depth</node> but occasionally showing a little flair . 

after seeing his latest performance in this film , i've changed my mind -- this guy can act , but he also has that <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">forceful</node> presence that most certainly will make him one of those $20 million superstars . 

here , he plays jack foley , a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living . 

he does it because it's fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won't start . 

he goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">break out</node> five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend , buddy ( ving rhames ) . 

we're then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) , a u . s . marshall who , conveniently , is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes . 

fortunately , they take her hostage , and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety . 

the central conflict <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">arises</node> when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another , though their respective jobs make them <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">superficially</node> incompatible .

at first , i kind of felt that it was a gimmick , but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction , too . 

it's a fun gimmick , though , and soderbergh treats the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">material</node> with enough humor that everything comes off naturally . 

i've only seen a few of soderbergh's films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex , lies , and videotape ) , but i think he's excellent at what he does . 

he's an artist without making it obvious , and without being pretentious , which is always admirable . 

he uses tricks , yes ( lots of freeze-frame stuff here ) , but it all adds to the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">smooth</node> and quirky <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">currents</node> in the film . 

as i said , clooney is terrific , and he's matched by lopez . 

lopez is , of course , beautiful , but she can act , too . 

i can sense that she's <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">honing in</node> on her skills , for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures ( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u-turn ) . 

the two actors have <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">arresting</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">chemistry</node> with one another -- the best scene in the film , by far , is the seduction scene . 

the brilliance of this scene is also due , in part , to soderbergh , for he <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">cuts</node> back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later . 

the scene is a series of <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">soft</node> nuances and glances , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">layered</node> upon <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">light</node> dialogue , and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema -- meaningful and engrossing .

B3ACF6A4-E688-481F-B8D6-98D143A29434,"the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">shape</node> , or <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">form</node> . 

it's been done throughout film history over and over again , and has become one of the many sub-genres , like the prep school sub-genre , the angst-filled teen sub-genre , and the slasher sub-genre . 

what makes "" peter's friends "" so remarkable is not how it doesn't <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">follow</node> the rules of this sub-genre , but how it <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">follows</node> it so well , and creates characters that i wouldn't mind <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hanging</node> with . 

what are the rules of the reunion sub-genre ? 

well . . . . 

1 . you need a group of friends , most of them married or at least dating , and sometimes even married or dating eachother . 

2 . you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis . 

3 . they are not to have spoken together much since they <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">split apart</node> . 

4 . the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10 . 

5 . they all have to be slightly to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">highly</node> neurotic . 

6 . the reunion has to bring them together , seperate them with little crises , then bring them back together because , after all , they're friends . 

7 . there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited . 

8 . eightly , they're all unhappy or marginally so . 

9 . there's some sort of sexual <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">tension</node> amongst some of them that's <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">built up</node> over the years . 

10 . the friends are all <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">wildly</node> successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so . 

11 . the film is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">filled</node> with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song . 

since it <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">follows</node> these rules so <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">closely</node> , it will probably be ( and has been ) <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">coined off</node> as just a "" british 'big chill . ' "" 

and in some ways it is . 

both <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">follow</node> the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">big </node>confessionals , and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">broken</node> relationships . 

but while "" the big chill "" was , at least to me , a tad too whiny and unsatisfying , "" peter's friends "" <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hits its mark</node> , making this film funny , dramatic , and poignant . 

the friends of peter's were all in the same theatre group <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">back</node> in '82 , performig <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">wildly</node> outrageous british acts for people far too <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">stuck up</node> to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus ) . 

after peter's ( stephen fry ) wealthy father ( richard briers , hardly on screen enough to register , but oh well ) dies , leaving a giant mansion to him , he has to decide whether or not to keep it . 

not sure what to do with it immeadiately , he decides to throw a giant reunion party , inviting back all his old chums . 

of course , all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule . 

andrew ( kenneth branagh , also directing here ) is an actor who's unhappily married to a tv star , carol ( co-writer rita rudner ) . 

maggie ( emma thompson ) is a successfuly publisher of self-help books , but looks like she needs them more than her customers , as she is lonely and unhappy . 

roger and mary ( hugh laurie and imelda staunton , who were also married in "" sense and sensibility "" ) are married , and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk , but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died . 

and sarah ( alphonsia emmanuel ) is as promiscuous as ever , having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian ( tony slattery ) who's married and wants a divorce because of her , giving her doubts . 

as for peter , things seem okay . . . 

the film features lots of inner-friend jokes , and even some old theatre anecdotes ( which i at least find a lot of fun in , as i've done lots of theatre myself ) . 

and there are <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">big</node> confessions , brawls between the friends , and by the end , almost everyone is unhappy , even though some have resolved their problems long before the end ( which i kinda dug ) . 

the final twist would seem forced an <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">anti-climactic</node> , but for some reason , i felt the same way the rest of the friends did . 

maybe it's because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique . 

that's really what makes "" peter's friends "" so lovable : the way you just want to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hang</node> with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes , but when someone's in crisis , can come together wonderfully for one another . 

it's when you have a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">giant </node>crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pushing you away</node> that makes you realize you have true friends , and these people are true friends . 

not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s ( a decade i grew up in , unfortunately ) without taking us outside of the 90s . 

there are some 80s classics and anti-classics like tears for fears "" everybody wants to rule the world , "" but unfortunately no stupid/fun 80s songs ( i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film , i'd put some crap go gos song on , or at least some good old "" come on eileen "" ) , but this is the british 80s we're talking about . 

oh well . 

but anyway , the direction is pretty good , although nothing amazing . 

branagh's forte is really making shakespeare <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fresh</node> and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">magical </node>, but at least he's very good with making a less ambiguous film like this . 

the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman , with lots of good one-liners , and even some really bad but good puns ( to mock the fact that andrew lives in l . a . , peter , while cutting some logs , asks him is he has wood in l . a . , and andrew says , "" no , but we have hollywood "" - <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">punishment</node> like that ) . 

the actors , as in most speaking movies , are better than their <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">material</node> , though , with some <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">stand-out </node>performances to the six friends , as well as the outsiders like slattery , rudner , and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter's mansion . 

a little note should be made about hugh laurie's performance , as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this - i mean , i've never seen him actually act this dramatically . 

 "" peter's friends "" is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion , although i don't know what kind i'll have ( like most people , i don't look forward to my high school reunion ) . 

because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation , i just <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">look forward</node> to the day when i can have friends like that . 

","the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , <Metaphor> shape </Metaphor> , or <Metaphor> form </Metaphor> .

what makes "" peter's friends "" so remarkable is not how it doesn't <Metaphor> follow </Metaphor> the rules of this sub-genre , but how it <Metaphor> follows </Metaphor> it so well , and creates characters that i wouldn't mind <Metaphor> hanging </Metaphor> with . 

what are the rules of the reunion sub-genre ? 

well . . . . 

1 . you need a group of friends , most of them married or at least dating , and sometimes even married or dating eachother . 

2 . you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis . 

3 . they are not to have spoken together much since they <Metaphor> split apart </Metaphor> . 

4 . the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10 . 

5 . they all have to be slightly to <Metaphor> highly </Metaphor> neurotic . 

6 . the reunion has to bring them together , seperate them with little crises , then bring them back together because , after all , they're friends . 

7 . there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited . 

8 . eightly , they're all unhappy or marginally so . 

9 . there's some sort of sexual <Metaphor> tension </Metaphor> amongst some of them that's <Metaphor> built up </Metaphor> over the years . 

10 . the friends are all <Metaphor> wildly </Metaphor> successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so . 

11 . the film is <Metaphor> filled </Metaphor> with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song . 

since it <Metaphor> follows </Metaphor> these rules so <Metaphor> closely </Metaphor> , it will probably be ( and has been ) <Metaphor> coined off </Metaphor> as just a "" british 'big chill . ' "" 

and in some ways it is . 

both <Metaphor> follow </Metaphor> the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , <Metaphor> big </Metaphor> confessionals , and <Metaphor> broken </Metaphor> relationships .

the friends of peter's were all in the same theatre group <Metaphor> back </Metaphor> in '82 , performig <Metaphor> wildly </Metaphor> outrageous british acts for people far too <Metaphor> stuck up </Metaphor> to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus ) . 

after peter's ( stephen fry ) wealthy father ( richard briers , hardly on screen enough to register , but oh well ) dies , leaving a giant mansion to him , he has to decide whether or not to keep it .

B5BC5521-0AC4-460B-89D6-98D141531BEB,"note : some may consider <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">portions</node> of the following text to be spoilers . 

be forewarned . 

milos forman's first film since the ill-fated valmont , columbia's the people vs . 

larry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self-made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s . 

the film <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">unweaves its tale</node> in a chronological order : we <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">open </node>with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky . 

cut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">struggling</node> hustler go-go clubs in cincinnati . 

the strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last-ditch effort to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">salvage</node> the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">churn out </node>a promotional newsletter . 

this <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">evolved</node> into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history . 

what <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sets flynt apart</node> from other publishers is his <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">struggles</node> against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">driven</node> , single-minded insistence to buck the system and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fight</node> for his <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">freedom </node>of expression , regardless of personal cost . 

the people vs . 

larry flynt also <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">weaves in </node>the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bittersweet </node>story of flynt's true love , althea leasure , whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries , and who devotedly <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">stands alongside</node> him throughout his trials and tribulations . 

considering the serious nature of the film's theme - the importance of the united states' first amendment - the people vs . 

larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">light-hearted</node> and humourous . 

much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt's outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">elements</node> of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">points</node> , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity . 

the film's focus is on the flynt's many <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">battles</node> over first amendment rights and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">freedom</node> of speech , but the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">heart</node> of the people vs . 

larry flynt is the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">touching</node> love story between flynt and althea . 

larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">harsh</node> , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">side</node> . 

there's a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking . 

ultimately , the emotional <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">power</node> that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">battles</node> against censors , but from the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">strength </node>of flynt and althea's love for each other . 

woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">career-topping</node> performance as the irrepressible larry flynt . 

harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience , and a very compelling protagonist for the film . 

courtney love plays althea leasure in a<node type=""Conventional Metaphor""> startling turn</node> , completely <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">raw </node>and impulsive . 

it's a very <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">solid</node> performance , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">brash</node> and naturalistic , and love is extremely compelling ; it's difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">chemistry</node> with harrelson is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">dead-on</node> . 

edward norton , as flynt's <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">straight </node>, <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">level-headed</node> lawyer is often <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">upstaged</node> by his flashier co-stars in the people vs . 

larry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">upstaged</node> by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">shines</node> in his <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">big </node>scene where he addresses the supreme court in the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">climactic</node> scene of the film . 

one can sense the frustration that norton's character feels when harrelson's free-talking flynt <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sabotages</node> trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">heightened emotional punch</node> when norton's isaacman has the opportunity to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sway</node> the supreme court judges . 

milos forman <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">keeps the film moving </node>- although it runs over two hours , it never <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">drags</node> - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic . 

there's also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining . 

two minor quibbles with the film - it certainly seems like the people vs . 

larry flynt is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">in a rush</node> to get to its main theme , with flynt <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">battling</node> against authorities and the system for his <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">freedom</node> of speech . 

consequently , the first thirty minutes of the film , introducing and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">setting up</node> the characters , seem <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">unduly rushed</node> ; perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting , but i felt it would have worked better if this <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">route</node> was taken in a more leisurely fashion . 

it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the<node type=""Conventional Metaphor""> inner workings</node> of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt , althea , isaacman , and rev . jerry faldwell did , and on a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">superficial level</node> some of their motivations , but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">deeper level</node> . 

for example , why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton ( president carter's sister ) to be <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">born-again</node> is a mystery to me . 

then again , perhaps it was to him as well . 

these two <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">points</node> don't detract greatly from the film . 

the people vs . 

larry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 , and works both as a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">ringing</node> political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">advance</node> the cause of free expression , and as a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">touching</node> love story .

","note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 

be forewarned . 

milos forman's first film since the ill-fated valmont , columbia's the people vs . 

larry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self-made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s . 

the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky . 

cut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the struggling hustler go-go clubs in cincinnati . 

the strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last-ditch effort to salvage the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter . 

this evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history . 

what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single-minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost . 

the people vs . 

larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt's true love , althea leasure , whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries , and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations . 

considering the serious nature of the film's theme - the importance of the united states' first amendment - the people vs . 

larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light-hearted and humourous . 

much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt's outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity . 

the film's focus is on the flynt's many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech , but the heart of the people vs . 

larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea . 

larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , harsh , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate side . 

there's a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking . 

ultimately , the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors , but from the strength of flynt and althea's love for each other . 

woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt . 

harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience , and a very compelling protagonist for the film . 

courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn , completely raw and impulsive . 

it's a very solid performance , brash and naturalistic , and love is extremely compelling ; it's difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her chemistry with harrelson is dead-on . 

edward norton , as flynt's straight , level-headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co-stars in the people vs . 

larry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film . 

one can sense the frustration that norton's character feels when harrelson's free-talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton's isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges . 

milos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours , it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic . 

there's also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining . 

two minor quibbles with the film - it certainly seems like the people vs . 

larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme , with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech . 

consequently , the first thirty minutes of the film , introducing and setting up the characters , seem unduly rushed ; perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting , but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion . 

it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt , althea , isaacman , and rev . jerry faldwell did , and on a superficial level some of their motivations , but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level .

then again , perhaps it was to him as well . 

these two points don't detract greatly from the film . 

the people vs . 

larry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 , and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression , and as a touching love story .

a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city , utah . 

this was just one more thing i didn't know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke . 

maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise , but i think even if i had known , i would have been just as happy . 

a life less ordinary is quirky , eccentric , and downright charming ! 

not for everyone , but a definite <Metaphor> change of pace </Metaphor> for your typical night at the movies . 

","sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest . 

some people call it "" original "" or "" artsy "" or "" abstract "" . 

some people simply call it "" trash "" . 

a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings . 

definitely a generation-x aimed movie , a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke-based musical dream sequence . 

whew ! 

anyone in their 30's or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film . 

it's somewhat silly , it's somewhat outrageous , and it's definitely not your typical romance story , but for the right audience , it works . 

a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting . 

well sorry folks , but i haven't seen trainspotting so i can't really compare . 

whether that works in this film's favor or not is beyond me . 

but i do know this : ewan mcgregor , whom i had never had the pleasure of watching , definitely charmed me . 

he was great ! 

cameron diaz's character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp . 

the audience may find it difficult to care about her , thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him . 

misguided ? 

you bet .

besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch . 

the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable . 

after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it's hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more . 

a truly intelligent addition to it all , however , is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork . 

that said , the plot goes as such . 

david and jennifer are two very 90's high school twins with the typical "" relationship "" outline of don't-mess-with-my-life-and-i-won't-mess-with-yours . 

they demonstrate the well-known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today . 

david is the shyer , subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv , while jennifer is the wild , licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation . 

but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters , they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home . 

nevertheless , jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life , and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home , he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed . 

and , as said earlier , not to flip the town around into some corrupt society , but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them . 

not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town , but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place . 

people got hurt . 

they cried . 

they became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves , and that's when their physical world turned colors as well . 

this can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie , but to me the message is finally clear . 

i hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past , and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run , we'll never know what we could have done better . 

until the next great movie i see , i remain sincerely , danielle flynn , imr

jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment . 

despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">steals</node> the film , giving one good performance after another . 

pam grier gives a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">stunning</node> performance as jackie brown , and she is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">supported</node> by an incredible <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">mix</node> of talent--samuel l . jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster . 

more than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pool</node> come oscar nominations . 

describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can't say much or you <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">spoil</node> it for everyone else . 

i will <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">tread lightly</node> . 

jackie brown <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">opens</node> with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport . 

the camera <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">tracks along</node> with her , and ends up <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">revealing</node> her occupation . 

we are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers . . . 

for a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hefty</node> price . 

ms . brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away . 

however , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l . a . cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money . 

they try to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">reach</node> him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell's buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead . 

they try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing . 

but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell's friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail . 

ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops . 

after she claims to have said nothing , she <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">reveals</node> the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison . 

ordell doesn't like this , but they both come up with a scheme to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">throw</node> the feds and cops off their <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">track</node> . 

this scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">foul up</node> their <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">goal</node> . 

<node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">revealing</node> more would <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">spoil</node> the fun of jackie brown , and that's the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">biggest</node> reason to go see a tarantino film . 

tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably . 

his hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way . 

they talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends . 

of course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">arise</node> . 

and perhaps the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">biggest</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">flaw</node> with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pace</node> begins to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">drop</node> . 

of course , tarantino <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fixes</node> this by <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">moving onto</node> the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">climax</node> of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it . 

things are told from one person's <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">perspective</node> , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more . 

this all <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">leads up to</node> a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">side</node> . 

on the technical <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">side</node> of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film . 

however , this time around it isn't as nearly as impressive or original . 

the writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino's use of slang terms offensive . 

the story <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">jumps</node> back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it's much more easy to understand . 

his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">follow</node> , especially considering that the time is given during the "" <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">leaps</node> "" in time . 

perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel "" rum punch "" by elmore leonard . 

the dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fully</node> realized . 

the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good . 

and as with pulp fiction , the music is a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">highlight</node> , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bringing back</node> memorable songs from the 70s and 80s . 

the acting <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">side</node> of jackie brown is unforgettable . 

the performances are incredibly <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">rich</node> , with <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hidden</node> meaning behind every characters' actions . 

nothing is quite as it seems , and you can't really tell which side one person is on . 

the real treat , of course , is pam grier who <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">gives</node> an astonishing performance as jackie brown . 

her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits , which <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">play an important role</node> in the film . 

watching grieg , i could tell what was <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">going through</node> her mind , even if i didn't know what she was thinking . 

her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad , happy , or in deep thought . 

bridget fonda <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">gives</node> a very good performance as a druggie <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">couch potato</node> . 

i didn't even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham's in boogie nights ) . 

michael keaton comes across very well , as does michael bowen . 

chris tucker has a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">small</node> , but effective performance . 

samuel l . jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) . 

but no matter . . . 

jackson is very <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">strong</node> in his role . 

robert de niro is actually a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">little</node> annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell's perspective clients and friends . 

robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">developed</node> characters . 

he is present throughout most of the film , and he <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">holds his own</node> against jackson and grier . 

jackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and some offensive remarks . 

as a film by itself , jackie brown is a terrific <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">piece</node> of entertainment , with a complex plot to <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">draw viewers in</node> . 

however , one can not help but compare it to tarantino's pulp fiction , and expect great results . 

when compared , it <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">comes up short</node> , but <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">not that short</node> . 

it's a worthy effort , with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino . 

perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">discovery</node> of pam grier as a major hollywood actress . 

i can't remember seeing her in anything ( except for a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">small</node> role in mars attacks ! ) , but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one . 

expect to see her name <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">floating around</node> the oscar nominations ( and hopefully she will even be able to <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">nab</node> one ) .

they talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends . 

of course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to <Metaphor> arise </Metaphor> . 

and perhaps the <Metaphor> biggest </Metaphor> <Metaphor> flaw </Metaphor> with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the <Metaphor> pace </Metaphor> begins to <Metaphor> drop </Metaphor> . 

of course , tarantino <Metaphor> fixes </Metaphor> this by <Metaphor> moving onto </Metaphor> the <Metaphor> climax </Metaphor> of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it . 

things are told from one person's <Metaphor> perspective </Metaphor> , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more . 

this all <Metaphor> leads up to </Metaphor> a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose <Metaphor> side </Metaphor> . 

on the technical <Metaphor> side </Metaphor> of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film . 

however , this time around it isn't as nearly as impressive or original . 

the writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino's use of slang terms offensive . 

the story <Metaphor> jumps </Metaphor> back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it's much more easy to understand . 

his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to <Metaphor> follow </Metaphor> , especially considering that the time is given during the "" <Metaphor> leaps </Metaphor> "" in time . 

perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel "" rum punch "" by elmore leonard . 

the dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are <Metaphor> fully </Metaphor> realized . 

the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good . 

and as with pulp fiction , the music is a <Metaphor> highlight </Metaphor> , <Metaphor> bringing back </Metaphor> memorable songs from the 70s and 80s . 

the acting <Metaphor> side </Metaphor> of jackie brown is unforgettable . 

the performances are incredibly <Metaphor> rich </Metaphor> , with <Metaphor> hidden </Metaphor> meaning behind every characters' actions . 

nothing is quite as it seems , and you can't really tell which side one person is on . 

the real treat , of course , is pam grier who <Metaphor> gives </Metaphor> an astonishing performance as jackie brown . 

her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits , which <Metaphor> play an important role </Metaphor> in the film . 

watching grieg , i could tell what was <Metaphor> going through </Metaphor> her mind , even if i didn't know what she was thinking . 

her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad , happy , or in deep thought . 

bridget fonda <Metaphor> gives </Metaphor> a very good performance as a druggie <Metaphor> couch potato </Metaphor> . 

i didn't even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham's in boogie nights ) . 

michael keaton comes across very well , as does michael bowen . 

chris tucker has a <Metaphor> small </Metaphor> , but effective performance . 

samuel l . jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) . 

but no matter . . . 

jackson is very <Metaphor> strong </Metaphor> in his role . 

robert de niro is actually a <Metaphor> little </Metaphor> annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell's perspective clients and friends . 

robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most <Metaphor> developed </Metaphor> characters . 

he is present throughout most of the film , and he <Metaphor> holds his own </Metaphor> against jackson and grier . 

jackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and some offensive remarks . 

as a film by itself , jackie brown is a terrific <Metaphor> piece </Metaphor> of entertainment , with a complex plot to <Metaphor> draw viewers in </Metaphor> . 

however , one can not help but compare it to tarantino's pulp fiction , and expect great results . 

when compared , it <Metaphor> comes up short </Metaphor> , but <Metaphor> not that short </Metaphor> . 

it's a worthy effort , with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino . 

perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the <Metaphor> discovery </Metaphor> of pam grier as a major hollywood actress . 

i can't remember seeing her in anything ( except for a <Metaphor> small </Metaphor> role in mars attacks ! ) , but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one . 

expect to see her name <Metaphor> floating around </Metaphor> the oscar nominations ( and hopefully she will even be able to <Metaphor> nab </Metaphor> one ) . 

","quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers . 

after his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs . 

john travolta made his come-back and is now one of today's most bankable stars . 

bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor . 

jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier . 

most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she's never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls ) . 

that is , until now . 

jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction . 

after mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing . 

jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment . 

despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another . 

pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l . jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster . 

more than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations . 

describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can't say much or you spoil it for everyone else . 

i will tread lightly . 

jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport . 

the camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation . 

we are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers . . . 

for a hefty price . 

ms . brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away . 

however , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l . a . cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money . 

they try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell's buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead . 

they try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing . 

but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell's friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail . 

ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops . 

after she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison . 

ordell doesn't like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track . 

this scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal . 

 revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that's the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film . 

tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably . 

his hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way . 

they talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends . 

of course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise . 

and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop . 

of course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it . 

things are told from one person's perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more . 

this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side .

quaid , now hopelessly confused , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">follows</node> the advice given to him , by a 'friend' . 

he get's his ass to mars . 

mars is ruled by cohagen , played by cox , who charges people for air . 

against him are the rebels , who are mainly mutants . 

the rebel's need quaid to defeat cohagen , because quaid knows ( but can't remember yet ) about a reactor that produces air . 

eventually , quaid kills cohagen , turns on the reactor , saves the planet , and goes away with a beautiful girl , just like the guy at rekall promised him . 

throughout this plot , there is huge explosions , thousands of deaths ( and i mean a lot of death ) swearing , sex , and everything else that make's a good verhoeven ( director of basic instinct and starship troopers ) movie . 

naturally , there's some pretty imaginative deaths , with arms getting ripped off , someone getting drilled , and heads exploding . 

as you can tell , it's violent stuff . 

but it's done so stylishly , and of course arnie tones it down with a one liner , that's it excusable . 

the acting is variable . 

arnie , of course , is useless , but he goes has some good lines , and in the first twenty minutes , he even act's like a normal bloke , not like some action hero . 

stone , of course , is useless , making a pretty poor wife , and a pretty poor action hero . 

but , she does sex scenes alright . 

ticoton ( most recently seen in con air ) , again , is ok , doing some good action , but getting her emotions all wrong . 

one minute she hates quaid , the next she loves him , and she never gets this tranisition right . 

so , the good guys are awful . 

but , the bad guy's are excellent . 

cox is basically reprising robocop , but he's still great in this , and he <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">delivers</node> the best line in the whole film near the end . 

ironside is superbly evil , with an utterly emotionless face . 

the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">supporting</node> cast are fine , and not even the comedy sidekick ( this time in the form of a taxi driver ) is annoying . 

one disappointing aspect , though , are the special effects . 

ilm and dreamquest do some good work ( such as a subway station scene ) but the model work is not so good . 

some of the model heads look appaling fake , and quatto is a major disappointment . 

another <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">irritating</node> thing is the product placement . 

there are a lot of plugs ( and a good mars today gag ) however , the sets look great , and the special effects at the end of the film aren't too bad either . 

there's also a good soundtrack running through , by jerry goldsmith ( the omen , poltergeist , star trek : the motion picture ) 

overall , then , total recall is a hugely violent , yet hugely enjoyable , action fest , with a reasonable plot <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">thrown in</node> there too , some great bad guys , and some imaganitive death . 

for a schwarzenegger movie , this is not bad at all .

the rebel's need quaid to defeat cohagen , because quaid knows ( but can't remember yet ) about a reactor that produces air . 

eventually , quaid kills cohagen , turns on the reactor , saves the planet , and goes away with a beautiful girl , just like the guy at rekall promised him . 

throughout this plot , there is huge explosions , thousands of deaths ( and i mean a lot of death ) swearing , sex , and everything else that make's a good verhoeven ( director of basic instinct and starship troopers ) movie .

as you can tell , it's violent stuff . 

but it's done so stylishly , and of course arnie tones it down with a one liner , that's it excusable . 

the acting is variable . 

arnie , of course , is useless , but he goes has some good lines , and in the first twenty minutes , he even act's like a normal bloke , not like some action hero . 

stone , of course , is useless , making a pretty poor wife , and a pretty poor action hero . 

but , she does sex scenes alright . 

ticoton ( most recently seen in con air ) , again , is ok , doing some good action , but getting her emotions all wrong . 

one minute she hates quaid , the next she loves him , and she never gets this tranisition right . 

so , the good guys are awful .

cox is basically reprising robocop , but he's still great in this , and he <Metaphor> delivers </Metaphor> the best line in the whole film near the end . 

ironside is superbly evil , with an utterly emotionless face . 

the <Metaphor> supporting </Metaphor> cast are fine , and not even the comedy sidekick ( this time in the form of a taxi driver ) is annoying . 

one disappointing aspect , though , are the special effects . 

ilm and dreamquest do some good work ( such as a subway station scene ) but the model work is not so good . 

some of the model heads look appaling fake , and quatto is a major disappointment . 

another <Metaphor> irritating </Metaphor> thing is the product placement . 

there are a lot of plugs ( and a good mars today gag ) however , the sets look great , and the special effects at the end of the film aren't too bad either . 

there's also a good soundtrack running through , by jerry goldsmith ( the omen , poltergeist , star trek : the motion picture ) 

overall , then , total recall is a hugely violent , yet hugely enjoyable , action fest , with a reasonable plot <Metaphor> thrown in </Metaphor> there too , some great bad guys , and some imaganitive death . 

for a schwarzenegger movie , this is not bad at all . 

in fact , it's very good . 

","the booming introduction music finishes , and the camera sweeps over red mountains . 

we see two figures looking over a barren , and very red landscape . 

they kiss , then walk on . 

one of the characters ( schwarzenegger ) slips , and falls . 

the glass on his mask cracks . 

his face scruches up , and his eye's begin to pop . . . . . 

then doug quaid , played by schwarzenegger , wakes up . 

it's all been a dream . 

he wakes up next to his beautiful wife , played by stone , and the film begins . . . 

total recall is a typical sci-fi film wrapped around an intresting ( if far fetched ) plot . 

quaid , who has never been to mars , keeps on having dreams of the planet , which has now been colanised . 

one day , while riding on a train , he's see's a ad for a company called 'rekall' , which implants memories of a holiday , instead of you actually going there yourself . 

quaid chooses the 'secret agent on mars' memory , and then the s * * * really hits the fan . 

the implant goes wrong , and quaid really thinks he is an agent on mars for about two minutes , until he goes back to normal and can't remember a thing . 

however , everyone he knows ( his workmates , his wife ) turn against him , saying how 'blabbed about mars' and 'blew his cover on the mission' a strange man , called richter , played by ironside , wants to kill him . 

quaid , now hopelessly confused , follows the advice given to him , by a 'friend' . 

he get's his ass to mars . 

mars is ruled by cohagen , played by cox , who charges people for air . 

against him are the rebels , who are mainly mutants .

","one would think that david duchovny , star of the cult favorite "" x-files "" would be very careful in choosing his leading man cinema roles . 

at least one would hope so . 

one would be seriously incorrect . 

eugene sands ( duchovny ) is a surgeon so dedicated to his craft that he becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake and work more . 

it turns out to be a bad plan when he loses a patient and his license while under the influence . 

ten months later , in a seedy bar to score synthetic heroin , the doctor gets a chance to ply his trade when assassins gun down a customer . 

using a plastic water bottle and bar tubing , sands operates and saves his life . 

smalltime hoodlum raymond blossom ( timothy hutton ) is impressed with the cutlery skills on his associate . 

he kidnaps and then offers down-and-out eugene a position in his organization . 

blossom needs a doctor to patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic at a hospital . 

sand's temptation is that this will give him a chance to practice medicine again albeit illegally , big chunks of cash to fuel his habit and close proximity to the gangster's womanfriend claire ( angelina jolie ) , this film's babe factor . 

the would-be big time operator is desperately in need of help .

while the original alien film was a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">dark</node> , <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">enclosed</node> horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew , james cameron <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">took</node> the big-budget action film with aliens , which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing , although on a much-larger scale . 

<node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">and boy , did he take that route ! </node>

<node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">i'd say at about 165 mph or so . . </node>. 

the film <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">opens</node> 57 years after the original , with lt . ripley ( weaver ) being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel . 

if you'll recall , at the end of alien ripley , the only surviving member , cryogenically "" <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">hibernated</node> "" herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship . 

unfortunately , she thought she'd only be <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">out</node> for a couple of weeks . . . 

once she's returned to earth , ripley is quickly interrogated by "" the company "" , who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy . 

in truth , they believe her , as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an "" alien advisor "" . 

it seems that the colony planet was a once-breeding ground for the nasty aliens , and now all communication with the planet has been lost . . . 

it doesn't exactly take a genius to guess what happens next : ripley agrees , and before you can say "" <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">big</node> mistake "" , she and the half dozen marines , plus the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">slimy</node> corporate guy ( reiser ) , who has more than it looks like <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">up under his sleeve</node> , are off to the colony . 

when they arrive , they find the planet in ruins . 

only one survivor is found , a little girl , newt , who confirms that , yes , the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system . 

and soon enough , the marines come under attack from the aliens . . . 

what happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">sets this movie apart</node> from any other standard alien sci-fi movie : the action scenes . 

cameron directs them so skillfully , and so suspensefully , that you're literally <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">ringing your hands </node>by the time the finale <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">rolls around</node> . 

which features , in my opinion , the best fight scene ever recorded on film , as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death . 

many people will tell you that this film , while being a great action film , has no real drama and is all cliches . 

well , they would be wrong , my friends . 

if this film had no "" drama "" , then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 academy awards ? 

that's right , best actress . 

you know that any action film that has an oscar nomination <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">attached to it </node>for something other than technical stuff like editing and f/x has got to be good . 

in short , aliens <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">combines </node>all the right <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">elements</node> ( great action and f/x , drama , a good plot , good dialogue , and great villains ) into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time . 

then again , maybe not . 

movies <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">rise and fall</node> from glory and , sad to say , aliens was <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">wrestled</node> <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">from it's throne</node> of best action movie by another cameron film , t2 : judgement day , in 1991 . 

so who will be the next <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">king</node> ? 

well , let's wait until december 19th and see yet another james cameron film-the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">highest</node> budgeted film of all time-titanic to make that decision .

 <Metaphor> i'd say at about 165 mph or so . . </Metaphor> . 

the film <Metaphor> opens </Metaphor> 57 years after the original , with lt . ripley ( weaver ) being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel . 

if you'll recall , at the end of alien ripley , the only surviving member , cryogenically "" <Metaphor> hibernated </Metaphor> "" herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship . 

unfortunately , she thought she'd only be <Metaphor> out </Metaphor> for a couple of weeks . . . 

once she's returned to earth , ripley is quickly interrogated by "" the company "" , who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy . 

in truth , they believe her , as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an "" alien advisor "" . 

it seems that the colony planet was a once-breeding ground for the nasty aliens , and now all communication with the planet has been lost . . . 

it doesn't exactly take a genius to guess what happens next : ripley agrees , and before you can say "" <Metaphor> big </Metaphor> mistake "" , she and the half dozen marines , plus the <Metaphor> slimy </Metaphor> corporate guy ( reiser ) , who has more than it looks like <Metaphor> up under his sleeve </Metaphor> , are off to the colony . 

when they arrive , they find the planet in ruins . 

only one survivor is found , a little girl , newt , who confirms that , yes , the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system . 

and soon enough , the marines come under attack from the aliens . . . 

what happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely <Metaphor> sets this movie apart </Metaphor> from any other standard alien sci-fi movie : the action scenes . 

cameron directs them so skillfully , and so suspensefully , that you're literally <Metaphor> ringing your hands </Metaphor> by the time the finale <Metaphor> rolls around </Metaphor> . 

which features , in my opinion , the best fight scene ever recorded on film , as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death . 

many people will tell you that this film , while being a great action film , has no real drama and is all cliches . 

well , they would be wrong , my friends . 

if this film had no "" drama "" , then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 academy awards ? 

that's right , best actress . 

you know that any action film that has an oscar nomination <Metaphor> attached to it </Metaphor> for something other than technical stuff like editing and f/x has got to be good . 

in short , aliens <Metaphor> combines </Metaphor> all the right <Metaphor> elements </Metaphor> ( great action and f/x , drama , a good plot , good dialogue , and great villains ) into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time . 

then again , maybe not . 

movies <Metaphor> rise and fall </Metaphor> from glory and , sad to say , aliens was <Metaphor> wrestled </Metaphor> <Metaphor> from it's throne </Metaphor> of best action movie by another cameron film , t2 : judgement day , in 1991 . 

so who will be the next <Metaphor> king </Metaphor> ? 

well , let's wait until december 19th and see yet another james cameron film-the <Metaphor> highest </Metaphor> budgeted film of all time-titanic to make that decision . 

i can't wait . 

","every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre : with dramas , it was citizen kane , with arthouse it was pulp fiction , and with comedy it was , well , that jim carrey guy ( okay , so he's not a movie , but he did have a huge influence on the genre . 

not to mention an expensive one . ) 

sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big , sprawling motion picture event , as did forrest gump four years ago . 

with action films , it was aliens , whic was released to much hype seven years after it's equally-innovative parent , alien ( 1979 ) . 

directed and written by james cameron ( t2 : judgement day , the abyss , true lies ) , the authority on action films , it was a masterful encore to his sci-fi thriller the terminator ( 1984 ) .

actually , yes .

"," "" it's not good to know too much about someone , charlie , "" charles warns his niece , charlie ( margaret welsh ) , with a devilish grin . 

charlie is infatuated with her namesake uncle , her "" soul mate "" as she calls him since her mother gave her his name . 

there's a lot to know about charles , not the least of which is that he strangled 3 widows back east . 

mark harmon , who looks like anything but a killer but specializes in playing them , plays charles , the merry widow murderer in the 1991 hallmark hall of fame remake of the 1943 hitchcock film , shadow of a doubt . 

and to avoid any questions about his guilt , we see charles in action in the opening scene with his last victim . 

the story takes place in the early 1950s in the small town of petaluma , california , where charles heads to avoid the police . 

john gay's script uses most of the original screenplay by sally benson , alma reville , and thornton wilder . 

karen arthur's direction is certainly no match for the great master , but on an absolute scale , the movie maintains a high level of suspense . 

when supercilious and deceitful charles comes to pay a visit of indeterminate length with his sister and her family in petaluma , they don't know about his nefarious activities . 

he showers them with elaborate gifts to buy the love they had already given him anyway . 

two mysterious and exceedingly clean-cut writers for a magazine show up to take pictures of the family for a spread on the "" average american family , "" but their interest is focused on uncle charles , especially on taking his picture and learning about his background . 

charlie , who first welcomed her uncle's visit , begins to feel more and more uncomfortable with him and suspicious of the disingenuous magazine reporters . 

the picture advances with a delicate power using small details such as the newspaper article that the uncle tries secretly to remove and that charlie discovers . 

the beauty of the story is the pas de deux between uncle and niece as they try to out psych each other . 

she wants him to leave , and he doesn't want to go , what with a local , rich widow as a prospective victim . 

will charles kill charlie first , or will she get him out of town . 

harmon is wonderfully creepy and smug , and welsh is tough but trapped . 

with a deft touch the director sets up each scene , several with thunderstorms , and tom neuwirth's sepia-toned cinematography makes the movie feel as if it were filmed in the 50s . 

my only quibble is the director's awkward staging of the final scene on the train . 

is hitchcock's version better ? 

of course . 

is this one worth watching as well ? 

actually , yes . 

shadow of a doubt runs 1 : 40 . 

it is not rated but would be pg for adult themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up .

all of this is not to be taken seriously , of course . 

`sleepy hollow' is a lavish , frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children . 

if you've got a decent head on your shoulders , you'll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time .

more subplots - _many_ more - dot the big picture , but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light . 

all the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubick's cube . 

ricci and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals ( the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants ) out to have a high time in the big city . 

infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a several-scene cameo . 

hudson , as a pretty-in-pink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies' man ( jay mohr ) , trips , pukes and gets smeared with dog poop . 

are we laughing yet ? 

the film boils down to a mixture of the good , the bad and the gaudy , with the latter two overtaking the former . 

game performances - especially by love , rudd and plimpton - are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts and a constantly roving focus , here a combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle . 

too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one night stands for each other . 

 if this is "" 200 cigarettes , "" then get me 200 nicotine patches .

FE6CA89E-1AF3-433E-B8D6-98D141BF98E7,"look back at all the times in your life when there was a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fork in the path</node> to the future . 

some sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">irrevocably altered the course</node> of your existence . 

>from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">roads not taken</node> , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different . 

perhaps even more <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">dizzying</node> to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">impact </node>. 

maybe that's where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? 

film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that's why there's no shortage of movies about this subject . 

the best of the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">bunch</node> were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance . 

these themes <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">weave their way through</node> many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red . 

however , they are most explicitly <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">examined</node> in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">course</node> of his life . 

in his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : "" [the idea is] <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">rich</node> and interesting ? that every day we're <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">faced</node> with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we're completely unaware . "" 

while this approach has been the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fodder</node> for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra's it's a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy <node type=""Creative Use of Metaphor"">to plumb its depths</node> . 

the "" road not taken "" approach isn't just a plot device , either . 

writer/director peter howitt <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">expands upon</node> both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train . 

the audience watches , with <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">ever-growing</node> fascination , how this one event <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">impacts upon</node> every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family . 

as her separate destinies <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">diverge </node>and then <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">re-converge</node> , she becomes two completely different individuals . 

that woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit . 

one day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day . 

the scene of the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">pivotal</node> moment is a train platform . 

in scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station . 

on board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty . 

minutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . 

in scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging . 

she doesn't meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry's infidelity . 

<node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">juxtaposed one against the other</node> , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there . 

<node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">on one level</node> , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">deep</node> and wonderful experience . 

but , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">solid</node> acting , a script with a few <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">twists</node> , and a great deal of genuinely funny <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">material</node> , sliding doors still <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">fits the bill</node> . 

one of its most obvious <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">strengths</node> is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">substantial </node>from their motion pictures , and those who could care less . 

it shouldn't come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">leads</node> , is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">solid </node>. 

paltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">standout </node>. 

she plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">insecure</node> woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">severs the ties</node> to her old life and <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">embarks on</node> a new career with a new man . 

john hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable . 

john lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland's troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer . 

only jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">over-the-top</node> <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">vixen</node> , seems out of place . 

her attempts at <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">broad</node> comedy are occasionally <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">jarring</node> , and it's occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">element</node> . 

one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice . 

douglas mcferran , who plays gerry's best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">stealing</node> every scene that he's in . 

part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie . 

on one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">trapped</node> men into a life of monogamy . 

on another occasion , while laughing at gerry's plight with the women in his life , he comments , "" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . "" 

but it's not all in the dialogue . 

mcferran <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">tears into </node>this part <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">with relish</node> ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">top-notch</node> comedy . 

this is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb . 

the script is <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">shrewd</node> and inventive , <node type=""Conventional Metaphor"">combining</node> wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole . 

sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however . 

for those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time . 

","look back at all the times in your life when there was a <Metaphor> fork in the path </Metaphor> to the future . 

some sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it <Metaphor> irrevocably altered the course </Metaphor> of your existence . 

>from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the <Metaphor> roads not taken </Metaphor> , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different . 

perhaps even more <Metaphor> dizzying </Metaphor> to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , <Metaphor> impact </Metaphor> . 

maybe that's where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? 

film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that's why there's no shortage of movies about this subject . 

the best of the <Metaphor> bunch </Metaphor> were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance . 

these themes <Metaphor> weave their way through </Metaphor> many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red . 

however , they are most explicitly <Metaphor> examined </Metaphor> in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the <Metaphor> course </Metaphor> of his life . 

in his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : "" [the idea is] <Metaphor> rich </Metaphor> and interesting ? that every day we're <Metaphor> faced </Metaphor> with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we're completely unaware . "" 

while this approach has been the <Metaphor> fodder </Metaphor> for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra's it's a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy <Metaphor> to plumb its depths </Metaphor> . 

the "" road not taken "" approach isn't just a plot device , either . 

writer/director peter howitt <Metaphor> expands upon </Metaphor> both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train . 

the audience watches , with <Metaphor> ever-growing </Metaphor> fascination , how this one event <Metaphor> impacts upon </Metaphor> every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family . 

as her separate destinies <Metaphor> diverge </Metaphor> and then <Metaphor> re-converge </Metaphor> , she becomes two completely different individuals . 

that woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit .
